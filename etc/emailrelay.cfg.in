# stream open.
#
#as-proxy smtp.example.com:25

# Name: as-server
# Format: as-server
# Description: This is equivalent to "--log" and "--close-stderr". It is a

# message is forwarded. The filter is passed the name of the message file in
# the spool directory so that it can edit it as required. A network filter
# can be specified as "net:<tcp-address>" and prefixes of "spam:",
# "spam-edit:" and "exit:" are also allowed. The "spam:" and "spam-edit:"
# prefixes require a SpamAssassin daemon to be running. For store-and-forward

#
#address-verifier C:/ProgramData/E-MailRelay/verifier.js

# Name: anonymous
# Format: anonymous[=<scope>]
# Description: Disables the server's SMTP VRFY command, sends less verbose
# SMTP greeting and responses, stops "Received" lines being added to mail

# Name: domain
# Format: domain <fqdn>
# Description: Specifies the domain name that is used in SMTP client EHLO
# commands, server EHLO responses, "Received" lines, and for generating
# authentication challenges. The SMTP client will use an IP address in the
# EHLO command if the given domain is not a dotted FQDN. If this option is
# not used at all then the default value is the canonical name returned from
# a DNS query of the local hostname, or the system's FQDN on Windows.
#
#domain smtp.example.com

# Name: filter
# Format: filter <program>
# Description: Runs the specified external filter program whenever a mail
# message is stored. The filter is passed the name of the message file in the
# spool directory so that it can edit it as required. The mail message is
# rejected if the filter program terminates with an exit code between 1 and
# 99. Use "net:<tcp-address>" to communicate with a filter daemon over the
# network, or "spam:<tcp-address>" for a spamassassin spamd daemon to accept
# or reject mail messages, or "spam-edit:<tcp-address>" to have spamassassin
# edit the message content without rejecting it, or "exit:<number>" to
# emulate a filter program that just exits.

# bind listening ports. By default listening ports for incoming SMTP, POP and
# administration connections will bind the 'any' address for IPv4 and for
# IPv6, ie. "0.0.0.0" and "::". Multiple addresses can be specified by using
# the option more than once or by using a comma-separated list. Use a prefix
# of "smtp=", "pop=" or "admin=" on addresses that should apply only to those
# types of listening port. Any link-local IPv6 addresses must include a zone
# name or scope id.  Interface names can be used instead of addresses, in
# which case all the addresses associated with that interface at startup will
# used for listening. When an interface name is decorated with a "-ipv4" or
# "-ipv6" suffix only their IPv4 or IPv6 addresses will be used (eg.
# "ppp0-ipv4").  To inherit listening file descriptors from the parent
# process on unix use a syntax like this: "--interface=smtp=fd#3".
#
#interface 127.0.0.1,smtp=eth0

# Name: prompt-timeout
# Format: prompt-timeout <time>
# Description: Specifies a timeout (in seconds) for getting the initial

#pop

# Name: pop-by-name
# Format: pop-by-name
# Description: Modifies the POP server's spool directory to be the
# sub-directory with the same name as the user-id used for POP
# authentication. This allows POP clients to see only their own messages
# after they have been moved into separate sub-directories, typically by the
# built-in "deliver:" or "copy:" filters. Content files can remain in the
# main spool directory to save disk space; they will be deleted by the POP
# server when it deletes the last matching envelope file.
#

# Authentication options
# ----------------------

# Name: client-auth
# Format: client-auth <file>
# Description: Enables SMTP client authentication with the remote server,
# using the account details taken from the specified secrets file. The
# secrets file should normally contain one line having between four and five
# space-separated fields. The first field must be "client", the second field
# is the password type ("plain" or "md5"), the third is the xtext-encoded
# user-id and the fourth is the xtext-encoded password. Alternatively, the
# user-id and password fields can be Base64 encoded if the second field is
# "plain:b". It is also possible to do without a secrets file and give the
# Base64 encoded user-id and password directly on the command-line or in the
# configuration file formatted as "plain:<base64-user-id>:<base64-password>".
# Note that putting these account details on the command-line is not
# recommended because it will make the password easily visible to all users
# on the local machine.

# Name: client-auth-config
# Format: client-auth-config <config>
# Description: Configures the SMTP client authentication module using a

# secrets file should contain lines that have four space-separated fields,
# starting with "server" in the first field; the second field is the password
# encoding ("plain" or "md5"), the third is the client user-id and the fourth
# is the password. The user-id is RFC-1891 xtext encoded, and the password is
# either xtext encoded or generated by "emailrelay-passwd". Alternatively,
# the username and password can be Base64 encoded if the second field is
# "plain:b". A special value of "pam:" can be used for authentication using
# linux PAM.
