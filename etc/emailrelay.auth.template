# emailrelay.auth
#
# E-MailRelay secrets file.
#
# Point to this file on the emailrelay commandline, like this:
#
#     $ emailrelay --as-client=example.com:25 --client-auth=/etc/emailrelay.auth
#     $ emailrelay --as-server --server-auth=/etc/emailrelay.auth
#     $ emailrelay --pop --no-smtp --pop-auth=/etc/emailrelay.auth
#
# Each line in this file has four space-separated fields in one of the
# following forms:
#
#     client {plain|md5} <id> <password>
#     server {plain|md5} <id> <password>
#     server none <address-range> <verifier-keyword>
#
# For example:
#
#      client plain alice my+20secret
#      server plain bob e+3Dmc2
#      server md5   carol Oqng9/H7wAyKgbuqw5VzG1bNO6feqtblyiNEi6QuN5dH
#      server none  192.168.0.0/24 localnet
#
# Normally there should be one "client" line used to connect to a remote SMTP
# server and multiple "server" lines representing accounts used by clients to
# connect to this server (SMTP or POP).
#
# For slightly better security use MD5 hashed passwords when using "CRAM-MD5"
# authentication, but note that hashed passwords cannot be used with
# other authentication mechanisms. Hashed passwords should be generated
# by running the "emailrelay-passwd" program.
#
# Any unusual characters (including space, "=" and "+") in the "name" and
# "password" fields should be encoded using the RFC-1891 "xtext" encoding
# scheme so that they are representing as hexadecimal ascii as "+XX".
#
# Alternatively use "plain:b" instead of "plain" and then use Base64 encoding
# for the id and password.
#
# The "none" rows allow trusted IP addresses to bypass authentication.
