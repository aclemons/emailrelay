# Example fail2ban jail definition for emailrelay.
#
# Add this to /etc/fail2ban/jail.local.
#
# Configure syslog so that emailrelay warnings get logged to the
# fail2ban 'syslog_mail_warn' file (see /etc/fail2ban/paths* and
# 'man rsyslog.conf').
#
# Test by adding 'maxretry=1' and 'bantime = 30' and then:
#   $ fail2ban-client reload
#   $ logger -p mail.warn emailrelay: warning: "1.1.1.1;" failed authentication
#
# Choose action 'action_mw' to ban the address using iptables and
# also send notification emails using 'sendmail' (as configured in
# the 'default' section of jail.conf).
#
# Install the 'emailrelay-sendmail.pl' script to get the fail2ban
# 'sendmail' action to submit notification emails into the
# emailrelay spool directory.
