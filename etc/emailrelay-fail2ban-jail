# Example fail2ban jail definition for emailrelay.
#
# Add this to /etc/fail2ban/jail.local.
#
# Configure syslog so that emailrelay warnings get logged to the fail2ban
# 'syslog_mail' file -- typically "/var/log/mail" or "/var/log/mail.log".
# Refer to '/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf', '/etc/fail2ban/paths*' and
# 'man rsyslog.conf' for more details.
#
# When configuring syslog note that emailrelay emits logging using a syslog
# 'facility' of "mail" by default, but you can change this by using the
# emailrelay "--syslog" option, eg. "--syslog=local2".
#
# Test by using 'maxretry=1' and 'bantime = 30' below and then:
#   $ fail2ban-client reload
#   $ logger -p mail.warn emailrelay: warning: "1.2.3.4;" failed authentication
#
# You should see address 1.2.3.4 being banned by fail2ban for 30 seconds.
#
# Choose action 'action_mwl' below to ban the address using iptables and
# also send notification emails using 'sendmail'. Refer to the '[DEFAULT]'
# section of 'jail.conf' for pre-configured actions and for the mailer
# configuration.
#
# Consider installing the 'emailrelay-sendmail.pl' script if you want
# emails generated by fail2ban to go into the emailrelay spool directory.
