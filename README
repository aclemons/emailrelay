E-MailRelay Readme
==================

Abstract
--------
E-MailRelay is a simple SMTP proxy and store-and-forward message transfer agent 
(MTA). When running as a proxy all e-mail messages can be passed through a 
user-defined program, such as a spam filter, which can drop, re-address or edit 
messages as they pass through. When running as a store-and-forward MTA incoming 
messages are stored in a local spool directory, and then forwarded to the next 
SMTP server on request. 

Because of its functional simplicity E-MailRelay is easy to configure, typically
only requiring the address of the target SMTP server to be put on the command 
line.

E-MailRelay can also run as a POP3 server. Messages received over SMTP can be
automatically dropped into several independent POP3 mailboxes.

C++ source code is available for Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS X etc, and Windows.
Distribution is under the GNU General Public License.

Quick start
-----------
To use E-MailRelay in store-and-forward mode use the "--as-server" switch to 
start the storage daemon in the background, and then trigger delivery of spooled
messages by running with the "--as-client" switch and the address of the target
host.

For example, to start a storage daemon listening on port 10025 use a command like
this:

	emailrelay --as-server --port 10025 --spool-dir /tmp

And then to forward the spooled mail to "smarthost" run something like this:

	emailrelay --as-client smarthost:smtp --spool-dir /tmp

To get behaviour more like a proxy you can add the "--poll" switch so that
messages are forwarded continuously rather than on-demand. This example starts a 
store-and-forward server that forwards spooled-up e-mail every hour:

	emailrelay --as-server --poll 3600 --forward-to smarthost:smtp

For a proxy server that forwards each message as it is being received, without 
any delay, you can use the "--as-proxy" mode:

	emailrelay --as-proxy smarthost:smtp

If you want to edit or filter e-mail as it passes through the proxy then specify
your pre-processor program with the "--filter" switch, something like this:

	emailrelay --as-proxy smarthost:smtp --filter /usr/local/bin/addsig

To run E-MailRelay as a POP server without SMTP use "--pop" and "--no-smtp":

	emailrelay --pop --no-smtp --log --close-stderr

The "emailrelay-submit" utility can be used to put messages straight into the
spool directory so that the POP clients can fetch them.

Note that by default E-MailRelay will always reject connections from remote 
machines. To allow connections from anywhere use the "--remote-clients" switch,
but please consider implications if your machine is connected to the internet.

For more information on the command-line options refer to the reference guide
or run:

	emailrelay --help --verbose
