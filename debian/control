Description: E-mail store-and-forward transfer agent and pop server.
 E-MailRelay does three things: it stores any incoming e-mail messages that
 it receives, it forwards e-mail messages on to another remote e-mail server,
 and it serves up stored e-mail messages to local e-mail reader programs. More
 technically, it acts as a SMTP storage daemon, a SMTP forwarding agent, and
 a POP3 server.
