Description: E-mail store-and-forward transfer agent and pop server.
 E-MailRelay is a lightweight SMTP store-and-forward mail server with POP access
 to spooled messages. It can be used as a personal internet mail server with
 SpamAssassin spam filtering and DNSBL connection blocking. Forwarding can be
 to a fixed smarthost or using DNS MX routing. External scripts can be used for
 address validation and e-mail message processing.
