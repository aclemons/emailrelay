SMTP changes
------------
The 2.4 release adds support for the PIPELINING, CHUNKING (BDAT), BINARYMIME
and SMTPUTF8 extensions to SMTP. This means that messages in the E-MailRelay
spool directory that require BINARYMIME or SMTPUTF8 support in the next-hop
server will fail to be forwarded and end up with a ".bad" envelope file
if the server does not support those extensions.

This is similar to the older 7BIT/8BITMIME compatibility problem where a
message contaning eight-bit content, or submitted with the 8BITMIME MAIL
parameter, cannot strictly be forwarded to a next-hop server that does not
advertise 8BITMIME.

In this release E-MailRelay no longer tests messages for eight-bit content.
All messages are assumed by be eight-bit by default and fowarding will be
attempted even to a server without 8BITMIME. If this is not desired behaviour
then a filter script should be used to test for seven-bit or eight-bit content
and edit the Content attribute in the envelope file as necessary.

When upgrading consider having BINARYMIME and SMTPUTF8 features disabled
if they are not needed or not supported by the next-hop server in order to
avoid these incompatibility issues.

The SMTPUTF8 extension allows mailbox addresses with UTF-8 characters. This
might require changes to address-verifier scripts if they rely on mailbox
addresses being printable ASCII.

In passing, note that mailbox addresses passed to verifier scripts are as they
appear on the wire, so a badly-behaved SMTP client might send addresses
containing double-quotes and backslash escapes that are semantically redundant.
For example, a message submitted to "\A\l\i\c\e"@example.com will have the
address passed to the verifier with all the redundant double quotes and
backslashes present. Similar normalisation issues can arise when using SMTPUTF8
because of the way Unicode can represent the same string in more than one way.

Ideally address verifier scripts should not return UTF-8 results when being
called as the result of a remote SMTP client using the VRFY command without the
SMTPUTF8 parameter. There is currently no way for an external address verifier
to make this distinction, but the issue only arises when a verifier script
determines that an address is a local mailbox; for remote addresses the
returned address strings are effectively ignored. Neither does the issue arise
when the verifier is called as the result of a RCPT-TO command since the results
are stored in the envelope file but not passed back to the remote client. If
necessary the VRFY command can be disabled by using "--anonymous".

The SMTP server now makes a distinction between authentication mechanisms that
are advertised over an insecure connection and those advertised over a
connection secured with TLS. By default all available mechanisms are advertised
over both connection types but can be configured separately.

Event loop changes
------------------
The event loop code has been revisited, in part motivated by the rather small
limit on the number of simultaneous connections under Windows.

The Windows event loop now automatically switches to a multi-threaded
implementation when the normal WaitForMultipleObjects() limit is reached. The
worker threads do their own WaitForMultipleObject() function call and signal
back to the main thread when there is an event to handle.

The old EventHandlerList class has been removed, allowing the event loops
more freedom to implement their own lists, and the event emitting part
factored out into EventEmitter.

On Linux the configure script prefers epoll() to select().
