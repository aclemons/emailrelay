Version 2.3 is a relatively minor release. The main functional change is to
support unix domain sockets. Non-functional code changes include better
separation of interface and implementation in the SMTP message store.

Version 2.3.1 is a point release that includes the ability to specify the TLS
private key and certificate chain in separate files by using the
"--server-tls-certificate" or "--client-tls-certificate" option twice. The
first time for the private key file and the second time for the certificate
chain file.
