2.5.3
-----
The E-MailRelay 2.5.3 point release extends the "--log-address" mechanism,
replacing it with "--log-format". The "--log-format" keywords are:
* time -- timestamp, like "--log-time"
* address -- smtp server remote network address, like "--log-address"
* port -- smtp server remote port
* unit -- configuration name, eg. "--in-spool-dir" logged as "in"
* msgid -- smtp client message file id

On Windows all internal character encoding now standardises on UTF-8,
independent of locale or code page. For more information refer to the developer
document.

The SMTP server protocol can now optionally accept invalid SEND-FROM and RCPT-TO
commands that do not have angle brackets. This behaviour is enabled by using
"--server-smtp-config=nostrictparsing". Future releases might also require this
option in order to accept SEND-FROM and RCPT-TO lines with a space after the
colon.

The Windows event-loop will now flip to a multi-threaded implementation if the
number of handles goes above 64, allowing for more than 1000 simultaneous
connections.
