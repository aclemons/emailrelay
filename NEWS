E-MailRelay 2.2 is now fully C++11, so older compilers will not work unless
they have a "-std=c++11" option or similar, and this also means that
"uclibc++" is no longer supported.

The behaviour with respect to the "--remote-clients" command-line option is
changed in this release: previously IPv4 connections were allowed only from
the host's local address, as determined by a DNS lookup, unless using
"--remote-clients". The new implementation allows connections from any
loopback or 'private use' address, defined in RFC-1918 and RFC-5735. This
brings the IPv4 behaviour in line with IPv6, and it still honours the intent
of the "--remote-clients" option in protecting the naive user against
accidental exposore to the public internet.

This release has a new "make lint" option that runs "clang-tidy" over the
code and also "make cmake" to generate simple cmake files for a unix build.
