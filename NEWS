E-MailRelay 2.2 is now fully C++11, so older compilers will not work unless
they have a "-std=c++11" option or similar, and this also means that
"uclibc++" is no longer supported.

The behaviour with respect to the "--remote-clients" command-line option is
changed in this release: previously IPv4 connections were allowed only from
the host's local address, as determined by a DNS lookup, unless using
"--remote-clients". The new implementation allows connections from any
loopback or 'private use' address, defined in RFC-1918 and RFC-5735. This
brings the IPv4 behaviour in line with IPv6, and it still honours the intent
of the "--remote-clients" option in protecting the naive user against
accidental exposore to the public internet.

Some internationalisation support has been added, using gettext() for the
main program and Qt's tr() for the GUI. See "doc/developer.txt".

A systemd unit file has been added, although by default it is only installed
as an "examples" file. Use "e_systemddir=/usr/lib/systemd/system" on the
"./configure" command-line to have it installed by "make install".

This release has a new "make tidy" option that runs "clang-tidy" over the
code and also "make cmake" to generate simple cmake files for a unix build.

Version 2.2.1 adds support for unix-domain sockets.
