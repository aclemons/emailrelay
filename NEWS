Non-functional code changes for v2.3dev1...

Event loops have been rewritten; having common code for the list of event
sources (EventHandlerList) was an unnecessary complication, so the common
parts have been stripped out and moved to a new 'EventEmitter' class. The
re-write includes a multi-threaded event loop for windows that allows for
more simultaneous connections.

The SMTP message-store code has been cleaned up to better separate the
abstract interface from the concrete implementation that uses content and
envelope files. The separation was not completely clean when executing
message filters because they have to know where the message files are
stored. This has been resolved by passing a reference to the file-store
through the FilterFactory.

The filter timeout mechanism has been moved out of the SMTP protocol class
and into the filters themseleves. This makes the protocol implementation
independent of the lower-level GNet classes.
