2.5.2
-----
The E-MailRelay 2.5.2 release has very few code changes compared to the 2.5.1a
source tarball. The biggest change is to the Windows build scripts so that it
is now possible to build using "nmake" without needing "cmake" or Visual Studio,
and it is easier to use LibreSSL as the TLS library. Also, the "make2cmake"
script can now be run on Windows to create cmake files.

Refer to the developer document for more information.
