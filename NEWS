2.5.3
-----
The E-MailRelay 2.5.3 point release is to extend the "--log-address" mechanism,
replacing it with "--log-format".

The "--log-format" keywords are:
* time -- timestamp, like "--log-time"
* address -- smtp server remote network address, like "--log-address"
* port -- smtp server remote port
* unit -- configuration name, eg. "--in-spool-dir" logged as "in"
* msgid -- smtp client message file id

Incedental low-level code improvements include:
* use std::string_view and std::optional if c++17
* rework event loops to better suppress events going to reused file descriptors
* decouple ExceptionSource from event logging
* rename ExceptionSink to EventState
* better propagate ExceptionHandler pointers through containment hierarchies
* possible future migration of G::Path to std::filesystem::path
-   less implicit string/Path conversion
-   path usage pushed down into o/s-aware source files
-   streams initialised with G::Path::iopath()
* G::Cleanup handlers now 'noexcept'
* G::Cleanup's deliberately-leaky strdup()s better encapsulated
* G::File::mkdirs() without recursion
