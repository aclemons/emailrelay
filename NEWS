2.5.3
-----
The E-MailRelay 2.5.3 point release extends the "--log-address" mechanism,
replacing it with "--log-format". The "--log-format" keywords are:
* time -- timestamp, like "--log-time"
* address -- smtp server remote network address, like "--log-address"
* port -- smtp server remote port
* unit -- configuration name, eg. "--in-spool-dir" logged as "in"
* msgid -- smtp client message file id

On Windows all internal character encoding now standardises on UTF-8,
independent of locale or code page. For more information refer to the developer
document.

Other low-level code improvements include:
* use of std::string_view and std::optional if c++17
* G::Cleanup handlers are now 'noexcept' if c++17
* rework of GNet event loops
* decoupling of GNet::ExceptionSource from event logging
