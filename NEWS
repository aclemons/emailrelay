E-MailRelay Version 2 is a major release, with more complete support for IPv6
and TLS, a reworked Windows core, and non-blocking execution of external filters
and address verifiers.

There are some breaks in compatibility with earlier versions; in particular:
* the TLS command-line options have changed significantly
* the address verifier command-line parameters are simpler
* the format of the secrets file has changed, although the old format is still accepted
* the reserved exit codes from filters are handled differently
* the admin command-line is a bit different
