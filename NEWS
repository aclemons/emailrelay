The v2.4 release concentrates on low-level code, so there is no new SMTP
functionality and performance characteristics might be different.

Low-level changes include a rework of the event-loops so the Unix event loop
defaults to an epoll() implementation and the Windows event loop now supports
many more simultaneous connections.

The i18n of the main server (not the gui) has been extended somewhat by marking
for translation the text of most C++ exceptions. This is only relevant if
building "--with-gettext" and running with "--localedir".

The "--anonyous" option has changed slightly in v2.4 so that it will now force
the AUTH parameter on the MAIL command to be "AUTH=<>". Replace "--anonymous"
with "--anonymous=vrfy,server,content" to keep the same behaviour as before.

The "emailrelay-submit" utility's "--content" option no longer suppresses
reading of the standard input stream; there is a new "--no-stdin" option
instead. A dot on its own does not terminate the input any more, so use ^D or
^Z to stop reading from the terminal. Header-only content with no body text is
now permitted.

Authentication using PAM no longer insists on TLS encryption because the
"--server-auth-config" option can be used to disable password authentication
over an unencypted connection.
