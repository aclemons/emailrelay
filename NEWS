E-MailRelay 2.1 removes the backwards-compatibility features that were put in
to make the migration from 1.9 to 2.0 smoother. Refer to the NEWS file from
the 2.0 release for the details.

The creation of ".local" files for local-mailbox recipients has changed slightly
in this release in that normal message files are not created if the message only
has local-mailbox recipients. This will affect users of the "--address-verifier"
option where the verifier script returns zero.

The 2.1 release continues the migration from C++1998 to C++2011. It is still
possible to use C++1998, but in addition to loosing multithreading you might
also loose the installation/configuration GUI since Qt has dropped support for
C++1998.
