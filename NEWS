Multiple configurations
-----------------------
In previous releases E-MailRelay runs with one spool directory and typically
one SMTP server and one SMTP client doing store-and-forward. In this release
one E-MailRelay process can have multiple configurations, each with their own
independent spool directory, SMTP server and SMTP client. Everything still
runs single-threaded, except as documented in "developer.txt".

Refer to the reference document for more details.

More built-in filters and address verifiers
-------------------------------------------
E-MailRelay allows filters that are not simple scripts by using command-line
options like "--filter=exit:99" and "--filter=spam:localhost:783", with a
small number of special prefixes like "exit:", "net:", "file:" and "spam:".

In this release there are more built-in filters and address verifiers, including
"deliver:", "split:", "mx:", and "copy:" filters and "strict:" and "local:"
address verifiers.

Refer to the reference document for more details.

Delivery
--------
E-MailRelay can now act as a Message Delivery Agent (MDA) so it can deliver
e-mail messages to local mailboxes according to the e-mail addressees.

A mailbox is a simple sub-directory of some delivery base directory, defaulting
to the spool directory. So Alice's mailbox might be the "alice" sub-directory
"/var/spool/emailrelay/alice", containing envelope and content files. Or it
can have its own "maildir" structure, "/var/spool/emailrelay/alice/new,cur,tmp",
in which case the content file will be delivered to the "cur" directory and
there will be no envelope file.

The delivery base directory can be specified with the "--delivery-dir" option.
This can be useful if outgoing messages need to be delivered straight to
incoming mailboxes without going via the smarthost.

Refer to the reference document for more details.

Local files
-----------
In previous releases ".local" message files were created for messages with local
recipients (as determined by an address verifier) in order to create a separate
path for messages sent to the local postmaster. These files are no longer
created because E-MailRelay can now run multiple filters in a chain and it is
easy enough to write a filter to separate out these messages.

7BIT/8BITMIME
-------------
Previous versions of E-MailRelay test message content when a message is received
and populate the "Content" field of the envelope file as either "7bit" or
"8bit". However, the SMTP client code has always largely ignored this field and
it will attempt to forward 8-bit messages to a remote server that does not
advertise 8BITMIME, albeit with a warning in the log.

In this release E-MailRelay no longer tests messages for eight-bit content,
so the envelope "Content" field will always be "8bit". If this is not the
desired behaviour then a filter script should be used to test for seven-bit or
eight-bit content and edit the "Content" value in the envelope file accordingly.

The SMTP client can now be made to behave more strictly (see
"--client-smtp-config") so that it no longer tries to forward eight-bit messages
to seven-bit servers; eight-bit messages are failed immediately by marking the
envelope as ".bad". Enabling this behaviour will also require a filter script to
identify seven-bit messages.

PIPELINING
----------
This release adds support for the PIPELINING SMTP extension.

Previous releases allow pipelining of the SMTP QUIT command but otherwise
require SMTP requests and responses in turn. In this release the SMTP server
code allows all SMTP commands to be pipelined, whether or not the PIPELINING
extension is advertised. The PIPELINING advertisement can be disabled with the
new "--server-smtp-config" command-line option.

The response batching behaviour described by RFC-2920 is not implemented.

The SMTP client code uses pipelining only for MAIL-FROM and RCPT-TO SMTP
commands when talking to a remote server that supports the PIPELINING extension.
This can be disabled using the "--client-smtp-config" command-line option so
then each MAIL-FROM or RCPT-TO request waits for a response before continuing.

CHUNKING/BINARYMIME and SMTPUTF8
--------------------------------
This release adds support for the CHUNKING+BINARYMIME and SMTPUTF8 extensions
to SMTP, although they are disabled by default.

It is important to note that if CHUNKING+BINARYMIME or SMTPUTF8 support is
enabled in the E-MailRelay server then the destination next-hop server must
also support these extensions. If the remote server does not support these
extensions then messages may fail immediately when they are forwarded.

In principle filter scripts can be used to convert BINARYMIME and SMTPUTF8
messages to non-BINARYMIME and non-SMTPUTF8 forms (RFC-3030 calls these
"gateway transformations"), but it might be easier to leave these extensions
disabled in the E-MailRelay server if there is any doubt about the capabilities
of the next-hop server.

In previous releases address verifiers only need to deal with printable ASCII
addresses because of the character-set retrictions imposed by the SMTP protocol.
But if the the SMTPUTF8 extension is enabled in the E-MailRelay server then the
addresses passed to any address verifier script might contain UTF-8 characters
and this might require changes to the script.

In passing, note that recipient addresses given to address verifier scripts are
as they appear on the wire, so a badly-behaved SMTP client might send addresses
containing double-quotes and backslash escapes that are semantically redundant.
For example, a message submitted to "\A\l\i\c\e"@example.com will have that
address passed to the verifier with all the redundant double quotes and
backslashes present. Normalising an address by removing quotes and backslashes
is reasonably easy in ASCII but might be more tricky with UTF-8.

Another corner case with SMTPUTF8 is that the remote client might use the VRFY
SMTP command without the optional SMTPUTF8 parameter. In principle a UTF-8
address verifier script should not then return UTF-8 results, but in practice it
has no way of knowning whether the SMTPUTF8 parameter was used. If necessary the
VRFY command can be disabled by using "--anonymous".

Hashed passwords
----------------
Hashed passwords created by "emailrelay-passwd" that use the SHA-1 or SHA-256
hashing algorithm will no longer work when E-MailRelay is built using the latest
versions of the OpenSSL and MbedTLS libraries. Both libraries have stopped
exposing the relevant state variables used within their hashing functions. MD5
hashed passwords will still work.

Code size
---------
The source code now contains a lot of conditional compilation directives like
"#ifndef G_LIB_SMALL" that reduce the size of the built binaries.

The Windows build and the build of the GUI on Linux are not affected because
they are built without the "G_LIB_SMALL" switch.

These extra directives make the code rather ugly so they can be removed if
necessary by running:

	libexec/reduce.sh --undo

MTA operation
-------------
E-MailRelay can now be run as a complete MTA performing message routing and
delivery, with no need for an external "smarthost" to do the routing.

Refer to the user guide for a worked example.
