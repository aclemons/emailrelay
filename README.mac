E-MailRelay on Mac OS X
=======================

Building from source
--------------------
E-MailRelay can be built on a Mac as if it is a vanilla unix system; the
standard "configure; make; sudo make install" procedure for building and
installing from source should work well enough.

For best results use the "bin/configure-mac.sh" script to run "configure" with
directory paths that are more Mac-like (see below).

The "make" step will only build executables for the native architecture. Xcode
can be used to build universal binaries, and project files for xcode 3 are
supplied. See also "make universal" and "make image" in the "src/gui" directory.

Directories
-----------
The preferred installation directories are:
* "/Applications/E-MailRelay" for the application
* "/Applications/E-MailRelay/Documentation" for the documentation
* "/Applications/E-MailRelay" for the configuration (not "/Library/Preferences/E-MailRelay")
* "/Library/Mail/Spool" for the spool directory
* "/Library/StartupItems/E-MailRelay" for the boot-time startup script

Installation can also be done into the User "domain", ie. under "~/Applications"
and "~/Library" using "make install DESTDIR=~", although starting up at
boot-time will not then work.

Moving the system after installation, or installing to any other directories,
is not guaranteed to work correctly.

Binary distribution
-------------------
Graphical installation from the disk image has been developed using Mac OS X
10.5 ("Leopard"). Bug reports for other versions of OS X are welcome.
