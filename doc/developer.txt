E-MailRelay Internals
=====================

Module structure
----------------
There are four main C++ libraries in the E-MailRelay code: "glib" provides
low-level classes for file-system abstraction, date and time representation,
string utility functions, logging, command line parsing etc., "gnet" provides
network classes using the Berkley socket and Winsock APIs, "gsmtp" contains SMTP
and message-store classes, and "gpop" contains POP3 classes. All four libraries
are portable between POSIX-like systems (eg. Linux) and Windows.

Under Windows there is an additional library for event handling. Windows has
historically built network event processing on top of the GUI event system which
means that the "gnet" library has to be able to create GUI windows in order to
process network events. The extra GUI and event classes are put into a separate
library in the "src/win32" directory, using the namespace "GGui".

Event model
-----------
The E-MailRelay server uses non-blocking socket i/o, with a select() event loop.
This event model means that the server can handle multiple clients
simultaneously from a single thread and the only significant blocking occurs
when external programs are executed (see "--filter" and "--verifier").

See *C10K Problem* [http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html] for a discussion of
different network event models.

At higher levels the C++ slot/signal design pattern is used to propagate events
between objects (not to be confused with operating system signals). The
slot/signal implementation has been simplified compared to Qt or boost by not
supporting signal multicasting, so each signal connects to no more than one
slot. For historical reasons the slot/signal pattern is not used in the lowest
layers of the network library.

Event handling and exceptions
-----------------------------
The use of non-blocking i/o in the network library means that most processing
operates within the context of an i/o event or timeout callback so the top level
of the call stack is nearly always the event loop code. This can make using C++
exceptions a bit awkward compared to a multi-threaded approach because it is not
possible to put a single catch block around a particular high-level feature.

The event loop delivers all asynchronous events to the abstract "EventHandler"
and "AbstractTimer" interfaces. If these callbacks throw exceptions then the
event loop will catch them and deliver them back to the same interface through
the virtual functions onException() and onTimerException() respectively. If
exceptions are thrown out of _these_ callbacks then the event loop code lets
them propagate back to main(), typically terminating the program.

The two callback interfaces are brought together by having a concrete "Timer"
class that requires an "EventHandler" object to be associated with each timer.
The "Timer" class routes any exceptions thrown out of the timeout callback to
the designated "EventHandler" interface so that both i/o and timeout exceptions
are delivered to the same place.

In common with other event-driven frameworks this leads to a programming
model where objects are instantiated on the heap and the objects delete
themselves when they receive certain events from the framework. In the
"gnet" library the "ServerPeer" and "HeapClient" classes do this lifetime 
management; instances of these classes delete themselves when the associated
network connection goes away or when an exception is thrown out their
event-handling code.

Core class structure
--------------------
The message-store functionality uses three abstract interfaces: "MessageStore",
"NewMessage" and "StoredMessage". The "NewMessage" interface is used to create
messages within the store, and the "StoredMessage" interface is used for
reading and extracting messages from the store. The concrete implementation
classes based on these interfaces are respectively "FileStore", "NewFile" and
"StoredFile".

Protocol classes such as "GSmtp::ServerProtocol" receive network and timer
events from their container and use an abstract "Sender" interface to send
network data. This means that the protocols can be largely independent of the
network and event loop framework.

The interaction between the SMTP server protocol class and the message store is
mediated by the "ProtocolMessage" interface. Two main implementations of this
interface are available: one for normal spooling ("ProtocolMessageStore"), and
another for immediate forwarding ("ProtocolMessageForward"). The "Decorator" 
pattern is used whereby the forwarding class uses an instance of the storage 
class to do the message storing and pre-processing, while adding in an instance
of the "GSmtp::Client" class to do the forwarding.

Message pre-processing (see "--filter") is implemented via an abstract
"Processor" interface. Concrete implementations are provided for doing nothing,
running an external executable program and talking to an external network server.

The protocol, processor and message-store interfaces are brought together by the
high-level "GSmtp::Server" and "GSmtp::Client" classes. Dependency injection is
used to create the concrete instances of the "ProtocolMessage" and "Processor"
interfaces.

Simplified class diagrams for the *GNet* [gnet-classes.png] and
*GSmtp* [gsmtp-classes.png] namespaces are available.

Windows service
---------------
To get E-MailRelay to run as a Windows service there is a service wrapper
program called "emailrelay-service.exe". This program registers itself as
a service when run with the "--install" commandline switch. When the service
runs the wrapper starts the actual E-MailRelay server by looking for a batch
file called "emailrelay-start.bat" in the same directory as service wrapper
executable. It reads the contents of this batch file in order to construct the
E-MailRelay command-line, adding "--no-daemon" and "--hidden" switches if they
are not there already. The service name and display name can be put onto the
wrapper's "--install" command-line, and it is the service name that is used to
derive the name of the "start" batch file.

Directory structure
-------------------

  Parent directory for source code.

# src/glib

  A low-level class library, including classes for file-system abstraction,
  date and time, string utility functions, logging, command line parsing etc.

# src/gnet

Portability
-----------
The E-MailRelay code is written in ISO C++, although avoiding less-widely
supported language features like "mutable", templated methods and "export".

The header files "gdef.h" in "src/glib", and "gnet.h" in "src/gnet" are intended
to be used to fix up compiler portability issues such as missing standard types,
non-standard system headers etc. Conditional compilation directives ("#if"
etc.) are largely confined to these headers in order to improve readability.

Deficiencies in the standard headers files provided by older compilers are fixed
up by files in the "lib" directory tree. For example, the msvc6.0 compiler
sometimes does not put its names into the "std" namespace, even though the
std-namespace headers are used. This can be worked round by additional "using"
declarations in the "lib/msvc6.0" headers.  These work-rounds are kept out of
the "src" tree because they are not necessary for more modern compilers.

Windows/unix portability is generally addressed by providing a common class
declaration with two implementations. Where necessary a "pimple" pattern is used
to hide the system-specific parts of the declaration.

A good example is the "G::Directory" class used for iterating through files in
a directory. The header file "src/glib/gdirectory.h" is common to both systems,
but two implementations are provided in "gdirectory_unix.cpp" and
"gdirectory_win32.cpp". The unix implementation uses opendir() and glob(),
while the windows implementation uses FindFirstFile().

Sometimes only small parts of the implementation are system-specific. In
these cases there are three source files per header. For example, "gsocket.cpp",
"gsocket_win32.cpp" and "gsocket_unix.cpp" in the "src/gnet" directory.

Compile-time features
---------------------
Compile-time features can normally be selected with switches passed to the
"configure" script. These include the following:

* Debug-level logging ("--enable-debug")
* IPv6 (Linux only) ("--enable-ipv6")
* Configuration GUI ("--enable-gui")

Use "./configure --help" to see a complete list.
