E-MailRelay Windows
===================

Setup program
-------------
Installing E-MailRelay on Windows should be straightforward if you have the
setup program `emailrelay-setup.exe` and its associated `payload` files.

Run `emailrelay-setup.exe` as an administrator if you are going to be installing
into protected directories like `Program Files`.

The setup GUI will take you through the installation options and then install
the run-time files into your chosen locations.

If anything goes wrong with the installation process then you can still just
run the main E-MailRelay executable straight out of the distribution zip file.
Follow the `Manual installation` section below for more help.

Running the program
-------------------
After a successful installation you should see E-MailRelay listed in the Windows
Start Menu. This will run the `emailrelay-start.bat` batch file to start
the E-MailRelay server, and you should then see an icon appear in the Windows
system tray.

Configuration
-------------
E-MailRelay is configured though command-line options like `--verbose` or
`--spool-dir=c:/temp` in the `emailrelay-startup.bat` batch file.

These options are all documented in the reference document, although there are
some Windows-specific variations:

* The `--syslog` option refers to the Windows Event Viewer's Application log.
* The `--no-daemon` option is used to disable the icon in the system tray.
* The `--hidden` option with `--no-daemon` hides all windows and suppresses message boxes.

Account information can be configured by editing the E-MailRelay `secrets` file.
Look for the `--client-auth` or `--server-auth` options in the startup batch
file to find out where this is.

Manual installation
-------------------
The manual installation process for when you do not have the self-extracting
setup program, goes something like this:

* Create a new program directory `c:\Program Files\E-MailRelay`
* Copy the packaged files into `c:\Program Files\E-MailRelay`
* Create a new spool directory `c:\ProgramData\E-MailRelay\spool`
* Create a new text file, eg. `c:\ProgramData\E-MailRelay\emailrelay-auth.txt`, to contain account details
* Add your account details to `emailrelay-auth.txt` with a line like `client plain myaccount mypassword`
* Right-drag `emailrelay.exe` onto the desktop to create a shortcut for the server.
* Add `--as-server --verbose` to the server shortcut properties in the `target` box.
* Right-drag again to create a shortcut to do the forwarding.
* Add `--as-client myisp.net:smtp --client-auth c:\ProgramData\E-MailRelay\emailrelay-auth.txt` to the client shortcut.

Copy the shortcuts to `Start Menu` and `Startup` folders as necessary.

Running as a service
--------------------
If you are installing manually you can set up E-MailRelay as a service so that
it starts up automatically at boot-time. You must first have a one-line batch
file called `emailrelay-start.bat` that contains all the command-line options
for running the E-MailRelay server, and you must have a simple configuration
file called `emailrelay-service.cfg` that points to it. The configuration file
must be in the same directory as the `emailrelay-service.exe` executable.

The batch file should contain a single line, like this:

        start "emailrelay" "C:\Program Files\E-MailRelay\emailrelay.exe" --forward-to smtp.example.com:25 ...

There is no need to use `--no-daemon` and `--hidden`; these are added
automatically.

The contents of the configuration file can be a single line like this:

        dir-config="C:\ProgramData\E-MailRelay"

Then just run `emailrelay-service --install` from an Administrator command
prompt to install the service.

Every time the service starts it reads the configuration file and the startup
batch file in order to run the E-MailRelelay program.

If you need to run multiple E-MailRelay services then put a unique service
name and display name on the `emailrelay-service --install <name> <display-name>`
command-line. The service name you give is used to derive the name of the
`<name>-start.bat` batch file that contains the E-MailRelay server's
command-line options, so you will need to create that first.

Uninstall
---------
To uninstall:

* Stop the program and/or the service (`ControlPanel`->`SystemAndSecurity`->`AdministrativeTools`->`Services`).
* Uninstall the service, if installed (`emailrelay-service --remove`).
* Delete the files from the E-MailRelay `program files` folder (eg. `C:\Program Files\E-MailRelay`).
* Delete the files from the E-MailRelay `program data` folder (eg. `C:\ProgramData\E-MailRelay`).
* Delete any desktop shortcuts (eg. `%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\E-MailRelay.lnk`).
* Delete any start menu shortcuts (eg. `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\E-MailRelay.lnk`).
* Delete any auto-start shortcuts (eg. `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\E-MailRelay.lnk`).
* Clean up the registry under `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\Application\emailrelay`.

Diagnostics
-----------
E-MailRelay normally writes errors and warnings into the Windows Event Log,
which you can view by running `eventvwr.exe` or going to
`ControlPanel`->`SystemAndSecurity`->`AdministrativeTools`->`EventViewer`; from
there look under `Windows Logs` and `Application`.

You can increase the verbosity of the logging by adding the `--verbose` option
to the E-MailRelay command-line, typically by editing the `emailrelay-start.bat`
batch script.

The Windows Event Log is a bit clunky, so consider using daily log files by
using the E-MailRelay `--log-file` option with the special `%d` date
placeholder. Then turn off the event-log logging with `--no-syslog`.

Testing with telnet
-------------------
The `telnet` program can be used for testing an E-MailRelay server. You should
start by enabling the Windows telnet client using
`ControlPanel`->`Programs`->`TurnWindowsFeaturesOnAndOff`.

Then run telnet from a command prompt, using `localhost` and the E-MailRelay
port number as command-line parameters:

        telnet localhost 25

This should show a greeting from the E-MailRelay server and then you can
start typing [SMTP][] commands like `EHLO`, `MAIL FROM:<..>`, `RCPT TO:<...>`
and `DATA`.

Building from source
--------------------
E-MailRelay can be compiled on Windows using Microsoft Visual Studio C++ (MSVC)
or mingw-w64. For MSVC builds there is a perl script (`winbuild`) that creates
`cmake` files from the autotools makefiles, runs `cmake` to create the MSVC
project files and then runs `msbuild` to compile E-MailRelay. If perl, cmake,
MSVC, Qt and mbedTLS source are installed in the right way then the
`winbuild.bat` batch file should be able to do a complete MSVC release build
in one go.
