Under Windows there are a few minor differences. Use "--help --verbose" to see
the complete list.

Message store
-------------
Mail messages are stored as text files in the configured spool directory. Each
message is represented as an envelope file and a content file. The envelope
file contains parameters relevant to the SMTP dialogue, and the content file
contains the RFC822 headers and body text.

The filenames used in the message store have a prefix of "emailrelay", followed
by a process-id, timestamp and sequence number, followed by "envelope" or
"content". The envelope files then have an additional suffix to implement a
simple locking scheme.

The envelope file suffixes are:
* ".new" -- while the envelope is first being written
* <none> -- while the message is spooled
* ".busy" -- while the message is being forwarded
* ".bad" -- if the message cannot be forwarded
* ".local" -- for copies of the envelope file for delivery to local recipients

Copies of the content file for delivery to local recipients will also have
a "local" suffix.

If a message cannot be forwarded the envelope file is given a "bad" suffix,
and the failure reason is written into the file.

Mail processing
---------------
The "--filter" command-line switch allows you to specify a mail pre-processor
program which operates on mail messages as they pass through the E-MailRelay
system. The mail pre-processor program is run as soon as the mail message has
been stored in the spool directory, with the full path of the content file
added onto the end of the given command line.

For example, the following command will start a proxy server on port 10025
which processes mail using the specified filter program, and then forwards the
mail on to the system's default MTA (on port 25):

	emailrelay --as-proxy localhost:smtp --port 10025 --no-syslog \
	  --filter $HOME/myfilter --spool-dir $HOME/spool

The pre-processor program should terminate with an exit code of zero to
indicate success, or a value between 1 and 99 to indicate failure. Exit codes
between 100 and 107 are reserved for special processing: 100 is used to cancel
all further processing of the message, and 103 has the effect of immediately
expiring any "--poll" timer.

If the pre-processor program terminates with a non-zero exit code then the
first few thousand characters of the standard output stream are searched for a
line starting with "<<" or "[[" followed by ">>" or "]]" respectively. The text
in between is taken as a failure reason, and passed back to the SMTP client.

The pre-processor program can edit any part of the message's envelope file or
content file: E-MailRelay remembers nothing about the message while the
pre-processor is running, except the filename. But if the message is deleted
by the pre-processor then E-MailRelay may be upset, so to avoid the error
message use an exit code of 100.

If the pre-processor program creates completely new messages in the spool
directory then they may not be processed immediately, or they may be completely
ignored. To get E-MailRelay to pick up any new messages you create in the spool
directory use the "--poll" switch, or run "emailrelay --as-client" from within
the pre-processor program.

As an example of a simple pre-processor this shell script examines the sending
client's IP address and conditionally passes the message into "sendmail" (using
the sendmail command-line interface rather than SMTP):

	#!/bin/sh
	# filter.sh
	content="${1}"
	envelope="`echo \"${content}\" | sed 's/content/envelope.new/'`"
	ip="`awk '/MailRelay-Client:/ {print $2;exit}' \"${envelope}\"`"
	if test "${ip}" = "192.168.0.2"
	then
		cat "${content}" | /usr/sbin/sendmail -t
		rm -f "${envelope}" "${content}"
		exit 100 # <= cancel further processing by emailrelay
	fi
	exit 0

The first thing this script does is convert the path of the content file which
it is given, into the corresponding envelope file. It then extracts the
client's IP address out of the envelope file using "awk". If this matches the
fixed address then it pipes the message content into sendmail, deletes the
message and exits with a value of 100. The exit value of 100 tells E-MailRelay
to forget the message, and not to complain about the files disappearing.

For Windows this example can be rewritten in JavaScript:

	// filter.js
	var content = WScript.Arguments(0) ;
	var envelope = content.substr(0,content.length-7) + "envelope.new" ;
	var fs = WScript.CreateObject( "Scripting.FileSystemObject" ) ;
	var ts = fs.OpenTextFile( envelope , 1 , false ) ;
	var e = ts.ReadAll() ;
	ts.Close() ;
	var re = new RegExp( "MailRelay-Client: \(.*\)" ) ;
	var ip = e.match(re)[1] ;
	if( ip == "192.168.0.2" )
	{
		var sh = WScript.CreateObject( "Wscript.Shell" ) ;
		sh.Run( "sendmail " + content ) ; // bogus
		fs.DeleteFile( content ) ;
		fs.DeleteFile( envelope ) ;
		WScript.Quit( 100 )
	}
	WScript.Quit( 0 ) ;

Windows pre-processor programs written in JavaScript can be run using
"cscript", with an E-MailRelay "--filter" switch something like this:

	--filter "c:/windows/system32/cscript.exe //nologo c:/program\ files/emailrelay/filter.js"

Note how the space character in the path is escaped with a backslash.

As an example of more complex processing there is a "--filter" script included
in the distribution ("emailrelay-process.sh") that does rot-13 masking of
messages.  This script also does some simple MIME encoding, so that the masked
message appears as an attachment within a plaintext bearer message.

E-MailRelay also has a "--client-filter" switch that enables pre-processing of
messages just before they are forwarded, rather then after they are stored. The
disadvantage is that by then it is too late to notify the SMTP client of any
processing failures, so in many applications using "--filter" is more useful.

Bear in mind the following points when writing "--filter" programs:
* The standard input and output are not used; the content filename is passed on the command line.
* Programs run with a reduced set of environment variables.
* The E-MailRelay process is completely blocked while the "--filter" program runs.
* E-MailRelay files use CR-LF line terminators, as required by the RFCs.
* Envelope files will have a file extension of ".new" or ".busy" when the program runs.
* Windows scripts may need to be run via "cscript" or a batch file wrapper.

It is also possible to do message pre-processing in a separate server process by
using "net:<address>:<port>" as the "--filter" or "--client-filter" switch
parameter. E-MailRelay connects to this address and then uses a simple
line-based dialog as each e-mail message is processed where it sends the
full path of the message content file in one line and expects the remote process
to respond with an "ok" line if the message is to be accepted or an error
message. One advantage of using a network pre-processor compared to running a
program is that the E-MailRelay server is not blocked while the messages are
being pre-processed.

Address verification
--------------------
By default the E-MailRelay server will accept all addresses for incoming e-mails
as valid. However, this default behaviour can be modified by using an external
verifier program, specified with the "--verifier" command-line switch, so that
you get to choose which recipient addresses are accepted as valid and which are
rejected.

The external verifier program is passed a command-line containing: (1) the full
e-mail address as supplied by the remote client, (2) the user-name part of the
address in upper-case, (3) the host-name part in upper-case, (4) the local
host's fully qualified domain name in upper-case, (5) the "MAIL" command's
"FROM:" address as supplied by the client or the empty string in the case of the
"VRFY" command, (6) the IP address of the client connection, (7) the
authentication mechanism used by the client ("NONE" if trusted), and (8) either
the authentication name or the fourth field from authentication secrets file if
a trusted IP address.

So, for example, a verifier script called "myverifier" might be run with the
following command-line:

	myverifier me@myhost.mydomain ME MYHOST.MYDOMAIN MYHOST.MYDOMAIN bob@other.net 192.168.0.1 LOGIN bob

The verifier program is expected to generate two lines of output on the standard
output stream and then terminate with a specific exit code.

For valid non-local addresses the first line of output is ignored, the second
line should be copied from the first command-line argument, and the exit
value should be one.

	#!/bin/sh
	# address verifier -- accept all (252)
	echo ""
	echo $1
	exit 1

For valid local addresses, where messages are to be delivered to a local
mailbox, the verifier is expected to write two lines to the standard output --
the full name associated with the mailbox, and the canonical mailbox name -- and
then exit with a value of zero.

	#!/bin/sh
	# address verifier -- accept as local (250)
	echo Local Postmaster '<postmaster@localhost>'
	echo postmaster
	exit 0

(In practice local delivery just means that the message files in the spool
directory are copied and given a ".local" filename suffix.)

For invalid addresses the exit value should be greater than one, and anything
written to the standard output is taken as the failure reason. (Only the few
few thousand characters are read from the verifier's standard output stream; any
more is thrown away.)

	#!/bin/sh
	# address verifier -- reject as invalid (550)
	echo invalid address: $1
	exit 2

To indicate a temporary failure this can be changed to an exit code of 3.

	#!/bin/sh
	# address verifier -- reject as temporarily invalid (450)
	echo address unavailable: $1
	exit 3

If the exit code is 100 then the connection is aborted immediately.

	#!/bin/sh
	# address verifier -- abort
	exit 100

In this more complete example all addresses are accepted as long as they contain
an "at" character:

	#!/bin/sh
	# address verifier -- accept only if containing an at sign
	address="$1"
	expr "${address}" : ".*@" > /dev/null || exit 2
	echo ""
	echo "${address}"
	exit 1 # accept

As another example, this verifier script accepts all recipient addresses by
default, but rejects remote addresses if the client has bypassed authentication
by connecting on a trusted IP address:

	#!/bin/sh
	# address verifier
	address="$1"
	host="$3"
	local_domain="$4"
	auth_mechanism="$7"
	if test -z "${auth_mechanism}" ; then auth_mechanism="NONE" ; fi
	if test "${auth_mechanism}" = "NONE" -a "${host}" != "${local_domain}"
	then
		echo "cannot relay without authentication"
		exit 2 # reject the recipient address
	fi
	echo ""
	echo "${address}"
	exit 1 # accept the recipient address

or in JavaScript for Windows:

	// verifier.js
	var address = WScript.Arguments(0) ;
	var host = WScript.Arguments(2) ;
	var local_domain = WScript.Arguments(3) ;
	var auth_mechanism = WScript.Arguments(6) ;
	if( ( auth_mechanism == "NONE" || auth_mechanism == "" ) && host != local_domain )
	{
		WScript.Echo( "cannot relay without authentication" ) ;
		WScript.Quit( 2 ) ;
	}
	WScript.Echo( "" ) ;
	WScript.Echo( address ) ;
	WScript.Quit( 1 ) ;

If this verifier script is used with a suitable "--server-auth" file then it can
be used to prevent open relay without restricting authenticated clients.

If the "--verifier" switch parameter is of the form "net:<address>:<port>" then
the E-MailRelay server connects to the specified verifier daemon over the
network and sends verifier requests as lines with pipe-delimited fields. The
expected response is another pipe-delimited line containing the same information
as returned by verifier scripts but in reverse, such as "3|address unavailable"
or "0|postmaster|Local Postmaster <postmaster@localhost>". The "inetd"
super-server daemon would be a convenient way to connect up the pieces in this
case.

Authentication
--------------
E-MailRelay supports the SMTP "AUTH" extension, as defined in RFC2554, on both
the server-side and client-side.

The authentication mechanisms currently supported are:
# "PLAIN"

  Passwords are stored in clear-text, sent over the network in clear-text, and
  are replayable. Defined in RFC2595.

# "LOGIN"

  Similar to "PLAIN". Officially obsolete although widely used.

# "CRAM-MD5" mechanism

  Passwords are not stored in clear-text, not sent over the network, and are
  not replayable. Defined in RFC2195.

Authentication is enabled with the "--client-auth" and "--server-auth"
command-line switches. The switch parameter is the name of a secrets file,
containing usernames and passwords:

	emailrelay --as-server --server-auth /etc/emailrelay-clients.auth
	emailrelay --as-client myisp.net:smtp --client-auth /etc/emailrelay-myisp.auth

The secrets file has a line-based format: blank lines are ignored and the hash
character (#) is used for comments.

Lines have four white-space delimited fields:
* "mechanism"
* "client-or-server"
* "userid"
* "secret"

The "mechanism" field must be "LOGIN", "APOP" or "CRAM-MD5" (case-insensitive);
the "client-or-server" field must be "client" or "server"; the "userid" field is
xtext-encoded user identifier; and the "secret" field is the xtext-encoded
"LOGIN" password, or the "CRAM-MD5" digest key.

The "xtext" encoding scheme is defined properly in RFC1891, but basically it
says that non alphanumeric characters should be represented in hexadecimal as
"+XX".

The client-side secrets file specified with "--client-auth" is used when
E-MailRelay acts as a client to talk to a remove server. The file should contain
at least one "LOGIN client" or "CRAM-MD5 client" entry.

A server-side secrets file specified with "--server-auth" is used when a remote
client tries to authenticate with the E-MailRelay server. The file should
normally contain several "LOGIN server" or "CRAM-MD5 server" entries, one for
each client.

The same secrets file may be specified for both "--client-auth" and
"--server-auth" switches.

The "CRAM-MD5" keys can be generated using the "emailrelay-passwd" utility.

As an example, the following secrets file defines "jsmith" as the username to be
used when E-MailRelay authenticates with a remote SMTP server, and defines two
usernames ("user1" and "user2") which can be used by clients when they
authenticate with the E-MailRelay server:

	#
	# emailrelay secrets file
	#
	LOGIN client jsmith my+20password
	LOGIN server user1 secret
	LOGIN server user2 e+3Dmc2

A "CRAM-MD5" version would look like this:

	#
	# emailrelay secrets file
	#
	CRAM-MD5 client jsmith 688498119.2977922305.1278051807.3015243256.2216875978.2833592318.2902375592.3156808220
	CRAM-MD5 server user1 4059553961.2316091643.3282746241.1444639637.3735501773.3404060330.2760590371.1201092398
	CRAM-MD5 server user2 2798539199.3144534242.3784876256.2879973305.2327113479.216533878.2436460291.2361831919

When using the "LOGIN" mechanism you have to store plaintext passwords in a
file. This is a bad thing. You should at least make sure that the secrets file
has tight permissions, and that the passwords in it are not also used for
anything important.

On the server side authentication is advertised by E-MailRealy in the response
to the SMTP "EHLO" command if the "--server-auth" command-line switch is used.
Authentication by the client is then mandatory unless the client's IP address is
configured as a trusted address.

Trusted IP addresses are configured with lines in the secrets file having "NONE"
in the first field, "server" in the second field, a wildcarded IP address in
the third field, and an arbitrary keyword in the fourth field. The keyword field
is passed to any external address verifier program specified by the "--verifier"
command-line switch; it is not used for any other purpose.

For example, this secrets file allows any client connecting from the
192.168.0.0/24 domain to connect without authentication desipte the
"--server-auth" switch:

	#
	# emailrelay secrets file
	#
	NONE server 192.168.0.* localdomain
	LOGIN server user1 secret
	LOGIN server user2 e+3Dmc2

On the client side authentication is performed when E-MailRelay has connected to
a server which implements the AUTH extension with one of the supported
mechanisms. If client authentication is enabled (with the "--client-auth"
switch) but the remote server does not support the AUTH extension, or does not
support the LOGIN or CRAM-MD5 mechanism, then E-MailRelay will log an error
and not forward any messages.

Note that some ISPs require separate POP/IMAP authentication before SMTP access
from a particular IP address is allowed. This type of POP-before-SMTP
authentication can be done outside the E-MailRelay system by POP/IMAP utilities
such as "fetchmail".

Pop server
----------
E-MailRelay can be used as a POP3 server so that POP clients have access to
spooled messages.

The following command-line switches are used:

# --pop

  Enables the POP3 server.

# --pop-port <port>

  Changes the POP3 listening port from its default of 110.

# --pop-auth <path>

  Changes the authentication secrets file. The default is typically
  "/etc/emailrelay.auth".

  The format of the authentication secrets file is the same as for
  "--server-auth" and the same file can be used for both SMTP and POP3
  authentication.

  "APOP server" entries are used for "APOP" authentication, "LOGIN server"
  entries are used for "USER/PASS" authentication, and "CRAM-MD5" entries are
  used for "AUTH" authentication.

  Note that the basic POP3 protocol defines only "APOP" and "USER/PASS"
  authentication, so some POP client programs may not be able to cope with
  CRAM-MD5 authentication using the POP3 "AUTH" extension.

# --pop-by-name

  Modifies the POP spool directory according to the name used by the client
  to authenticate with the E-MailRelay server. The client name is used as a
  sub-directory off the standard spool directory. So, for example, if a client
  authenticates as "bob" then the POP3 server will serve messages from the "bob"
  sub-directory, "/var/spool/emailrelay/bob".

  If E-MailRelay finds only the envelope file in the sub-directory and not the
  content file then it will look for the content file in the main spool
  directory, eg. "/var/spool/emailrelay". This feature can be used to save
  disk space if serving the same message to multiple POP clients.

# --pop-no-delete

  Disables message deletion: the POP3 DELE command will appear to succeed, but
  no files will be deleted from the spool directory.

Security issues
---------------
A significant security concern is the use of external mail pre-processors and
address verifiers (using the "--filter" and "--verifier" switches), and so the
following precautions are taken:

# effective userid

  Suid privileges are revoked at start-up, switching the effective
  userid/groupid to be the real userid/groupid values. If started as "root"
  then the effective userid/groupid are switched at start-up to those of user
  "daemon". Special privileges are only reclaimed when needed to bind sockets
  and do file i/o. Normally this means temporarily switching the userid and
  groupid back to what they were at start-up. However, when writing spool files
  after being started as "root" only the effective userid is changed, not the
  groupid, so that new files have group ownership corresponding to the
  "daemon" user.

# execution environment

  The mail pre-processor runs with an almost empty set of environment variables
  ("PATH" and "IFS"), and with no open file descriptors other than "stdin" and
  "stderr" open onto "/dev/null", and "stdout" open onto a pipe.

# configuration

  The mail pre-processor filename has to be configured using a full path, so
  there is no dependence on the current working directory or the PATH
  environment variable.

Some other points to note are:

# umask

  The program runs for most of the time with a "umask" of 177, switching to 117
  when creating spool files.

# buffer overflow

  Strings are dynamically allocated, so buffer overflow/truncation issues are
  avoided.

# remote clients

  By default connections will be rejected if they come from remote machines.

# remote configuration

  No configuration parameters can be changed through the administrative
  interface.

# use of exec() and system()

  No exec(), system() or popen() calls are used other than execve() to spawn the
  mail pre-processor and/or address verifier.

# file permissions

  After a normal installation the spool directory is has ownership of
  "root.daemon" with permissions of "-rwxrwxr-x" and messages files are created
  with permissions of "-rw-rw----". This allows normal users to list messages
  files but not read them.

  The "emailrelay-submit" program is given group ownership of "daemon" with its
  group set-user-id flag set. This allows it to create message files in the
  spool directory, and the files created end up owned by the submitter but with
  group ownership of "daemon".

# logging

  Logging output is conditioned so that ANSI escape sequences cannot appear
  in the log.

  Passwords and message content are not logged (except if using the "--debug"
  switch with debug logging support enabled at build time).

# information leakage

  The "--anonymous" switch can be used to slightly reduce the amount of information
  released to remote clients.

Security issues which relate to the SMTP protocol itself are beyond the scope of
this document, but RFC2821 makes the following observation: "SMTP mail is
inherently insecure in that it is feasible for even [..] casual users to [..]
create messages that will trick a [..] recipient into believing that they came
from somewhere else. [..] Real [..] security lies [..] in end-to-end methods
[..] such as those which use digital signatures."

The "Authentication" section below also relates to security.

Administration interface
------------------------
If enabled with the "--admin" command line switch, the E-MailRelay server will
provide a network interface for performing administration tasks. This is a
simple command-line interface which is compatible with "telnet":

	$ emailrelay --as-server --port 125 --forward-to localhost:25 --admin 10026
	$ telnet localhost 10026
	E-MailRelay> help
	E-MailRelay> quit

The "flush" command is used to get the E-MailRelay server to forward spooled
mail to the next SMTP server, as an alternative to running
"emailrelay --as-client" as a separate process. In proxy mode it is a way of
getting the proxy server to scan the spool-directory for new messages.

The "list" command lists the messages in the spool directory, "info" provides
network status information and activity statistics, and "notify" enables
asynchronous event notification.

Files and directories
---------------------
Following a normal build from source, a "make install" puts files in the
following locations:
* /usr/local/etc/emailrelay.conf
* /usr/local/etc/emailrelay.conf.template
* /usr/local/libexec/emailrelay/emailrelay-filter-copy
* /usr/local/libexec/emailrelay/emailrelay-poke
* /usr/local/libexec/emailrelay/examples/*
* /usr/local/libexec/emailrelay/init/emailrelay
* /usr/local/man/man1/emailrelay*.1.gz
* /usr/local/sbin/emailrelay
* /usr/local/sbin/emailrelay-passwd
* /usr/local/sbin/emailrelay-submit
* /usr/local/share/emailrelay/doc/*
* /usr/local/share/emailrelay/doc/index.html
* /usr/local/share/emailrelay/doc/README
* /usr/local/var/spool/emailrelay/emailrelay.*.content
* /usr/local/var/spool/emailrelay/emailrelay.*.envelope

This directory structure is constrained by the GNU/"autoconf" conventions rather
than the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).

To force FHS compliance you can use the "--enable-fhs" switch when running
"configure". This results in the following file locations:
* /etc/emailrelay.conf
* /etc/emailrelay.conf.template
* /etc/init.d/emailrelay
* /usr/lib/emailrelay/emailrelay-filter-copy
* /usr/lib/emailrelay/emailrelay-poke

For finer control of the directory structure the following can be specified on
the "configure" command-line (but note that the "--enable-fhs" will override
them):
* --mandir=<dir>
* --sbindir=<dir>
* e_libexecdir=<dir>
* e_sysconfdir=<dir>
* e_docdir=<dir>
* e_examplesdir=<dir>
* e_initdir=<dir>
* e_spooldir=<dir>

For example, running "./configure --prefix=/usr e_spooldir=/tmp/spool" will
create the GNU-style directory structure under "/usr" rather than "/usr/local",
and create the E-MailRelay spool directory as "/tmp/spool" rather than
"/usr/local/var/spool/emailrelay".

The default spool directory path which is built into the executables and scripts
comes from "configure" via the makefiles.

Even though the "--enable-fhs" switch overrides all other directory specifiers
during the build process, it is still possible to change the installation root
directory using "make install DESTDIR=<root>" or "DESTDIR=<root> make -e install".
But note that this will not affect the default spool directory path built into
the scripts and executables so the correct spool directory will have to be
specified at run-time with the "--spool-dir" switch.

If building the configuration GUI then you may need to set the "PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
environment variable to point to the ".pc" files in the Qt "lib" directory and
set the "e_qtmoc" configure variable to point to the Qt "moc" utility. You
may also need to set the correct library directory for Qt if it is wrong in
the ".pc" file by setting "LDFLAGS":

	export QT=/usr/local/qt4
	LDFLAGS=-L$QT/lib PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$QT/lib ./configure --enable-gui e_qtmoc="$QT/bin/moc"
