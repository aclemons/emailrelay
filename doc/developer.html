  <h1><a class="a-header" name="H_1">E-MailRelay Developer Guide</a></h1> <!-- index:1:H:E-MailRelay Developer Guide -->
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_1">Principles</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:1:Principles -->
    <p>
     The main principles in the design of E-MailRelay can be summarised as:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>Functionality without imposing policy</li>
     <li>Minimal third-party dependencies</li>
     <li>Windows/Unix portability without #ifdefs</li>
     <li>Event-driven, non-blocking, single-threaded networking code</li>
     <li>Multi-threading optional</li>
    </ul>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_2">Portability</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:2:Portability -->
    <p>
     The E-MailRelay code is written in Modern C++, superficially using C++17 but
     remaining compatible with C++11.
    </p>

    <p>
     The header files <em>gdef.h</em> in <em>src/glib</em> is used to fix up some compiler
     portability issues such as missing standard types, non-standard system headers
     etc. Conditional compilation directives (<em>#ifdef</em> etc.) are largely confined
     this file in order to improve readability.
    </p>

    <p>
     Windows/Unix portability is generally addressed by providing a common class
     declaration with two implementations. The implementations are put into separate
     source files with a <em>_unix</em> or <em>_win32</em> suffix, and if necessary a 'pimple' (or
     'Bridge') pattern is used to keep the o/s-specific details out of the header.
     If only small parts of the implementation are o/s-specific then there can be
     three source files per header. For example, <em>gsocket.cpp</em>, <em>gsocket_win32.cpp</em>
     and <em>gsocket_unix.cpp</em> in the <em>src/gnet</em> directory.
    </p>

    <p>
     Underscores in source file names are used exclusively to indicate build-time
     alternatives.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_3">Event model</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:3:Event model -->
    <p>
     The E-MailRelay server uses non-blocking socket i/o, with a select() or epoll()
     event loop. This event model means that the server can handle multiple network
     connections simultaneously from a single thread, and even if multi-threading is
     disabled at build-time the only blocking occurs when external programs are
     executed (see <em>--filter</em> and <em>--address-verifier</em>).
    </p>

    <p>
     The advantages of a non-blocking event model are discussed in the well-known
     <a href="http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html">C10K Problem</a> document.
    </p>

    <p>
     This event model can make the code more complicated than the equivalent
     multi-threaded approach since (for example) it is not possible to wait for a
     complete line of input to be received from a remote SMTP client because there
     might be other connections that need servicing half way through.
    </p>

    <p>
     At higher levels the C++ slot/signal design pattern is used to propagate events
     between objects (not to be confused with operating system signals). The
     slot/signal implementation has been simplified compared to Qt or boost by not
     supporting signal multicasting, so each signal connects to no more than one
     slot. The implementation is now a thin wrapper over std::function.
    </p>

    <p>
     The synchronous slot/signal pattern needs some care when when the signalling
     object gets destructed as a side-effect of raising a signal, and that situation
     can be non-obvious precisely because of the slot/signal code decoupling. In
     most cases signals are emitted at the end of a function and the stack unwinds
     back to the event loop immediately afterwards, but in other situations,
     particularly when emitting more than one signal, defensive measures are
     required (see <em>glib/gcall.h</em>).
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_4">Module structure</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:4:Module structure -->
    <p>
     The main C++ libraries in the E-MailRelay code base are as follows:
    </p>
   <h3><a class="a-header">glib</a></h3>
      <dd>
       Low-level classes for file-system abstraction, date and time representation,
       string utility functions, logging, command line parsing etc.
      </dd>
   <h3><a class="a-header">gssl</a></h3>
      <dd>
       A thin layer over the third-party TLS libraries.
      </dd>
   <h3><a class="a-header">gnet</a></h3>
      <dd>
       Network and event-loop classes.
      </dd>
   <h3><a class="a-header">gauth</a></h3>
      <dd>
       Implements various authentication mechanisms.
      </dd>
   <h3><a class="a-header">gsmtp</a></h3>
      <dd>
       SMTP protocol classes.
      </dd>
   <h3><a class="a-header">gpop</a></h3>
      <dd>
       POP3 protocol classes.
      </dd>
   <h3><a class="a-header">gstore</a></h3>
      <dd>
       Message store classes.
      </dd>
   <h3><a class="a-header">gfilters</a></h3>
      <dd>
       Built-in filters.
      </dd>
   <h3><a class="a-header">gverifiers</a></h3>
      <dd>
       Built-in address verifiers.
      </dd>
    <p>
     All of these libraries are portable between Unix-like systems and Windows.
    </p>

    <p>
     Under Windows there is an additional library under <em>src/win32</em> for the user
     interface implemented using the Microsoft Win32 API.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_5">SMTP class structure</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:5:SMTP class structure -->
    <p>
     The message-store functionality uses three abstract interfaces: <em>MessageStore</em>,
     <em>NewMessage</em> and <em>StoredMessage</em>. The <em>NewMessage</em> interface is used to create
     messages within the store, and the <em>StoredMessage</em> interface is used for
     reading and extracting messages from the store. The concrete implementation
     classes based on these interfaces are respectively <em>FileStore</em>, <em>NewFile</em> and
     <em>StoredFile</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
     Protocol classes such as <em>GSmtp::ServerProtocol</em> receive network and timer
     events from their container and use an abstract <em>Sender</em> interface to send
     network data. This means that the protocols can be independent of the network
     and event loop framework.
    </p>

    <p>
     The interaction between the SMTP server protocol class and the message store is
     mediated by the <em>ProtocolMessage</em> interface. Two main implementations of this
     interface are available: one for normal spooling (<em>ProtocolMessageStore</em>), and
     another for immediate forwarding (<em>ProtocolMessageForward</em>). The <em>Decorator</em>
     pattern is used whereby the forwarding class uses an instance of the storage
     class to do the message storing and filtering, while adding in an instance
     of the <em>GSmtp::Client</em> class to do the forwarding.
    </p>

    <p>
     Message filtering (<em>--filter</em>) is implemented via an abstract <em>GSmtp::Filter</em>
     interface. Concrete implementations in the <em>GFilters</em> namespace are provided for
     doing nothing, running an external executable program, talking to an external
     network server, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
     Address verifiers (<em>--address-verifier</em>) are implemented via an abstract
     <em>GSmtp::Verifier</em> interface, with concrete implementations in the <em>GVerifiers</em>
     namespace.
    </p>

    <p>
     The protocol, processor and message-store interfaces are brought together by
     the high-level <em>GSmtp::Server</em> and <em>GSmtp::Client</em> classes. Dependency
     injection is used to provide them with concrete instances of the <em>MessageStore</em>,
     <em>Filter</em> and <em>Verifier</em> interfaces.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_6">Event handling and exceptions</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:6:Event handling and exceptions -->
    <p>
     The use of non-blocking i/o in the network library means that most processing
     operates within the context of an i/o event or timeout callback, so the top
     level of the call stack is nearly always the event loop code. This can make
     catching C++ exceptions a bit awkward compared to a multi-threaded approach
     because it is not possible to put a single catch block around a particular
     high-level feature.
    </p>

    <p>
     The event loop delivers asynchronous socket events to the <em>EventHandler</em>
     interface, timer events to the <em>TimerBase</em> interface, and 'future' events to
     the <em>FutureEventCallback</em> interface. If any of the these event handlers throws
     an exception then the event loop catches it and delivers it back to an
     exception handler through the <em>onException()</em> method of an associated
     <em>ExceptionHandler</em> interface.
    </p>

    <p>
     ExceptionHandler interface pointers are passed around in <em>EventState</em>
     structures. All event-handling classes generally accept an EventState in their
     constructor and they pass a copy to all base classes and contained sub-objects.
     The default ExceptionHandler just rethrows the current exception, which
     typically propagates back to <em>main()</em> and terminates the program.
    </p>

    <p>
     However, sometimes there are objects that need to be more resilient to
     exceptions. In particular, a network server should not terminate just because
     one of its connections fails unexpectedly and a network client should not
     terminate just because the peer disconnects. In these cases the ExceptionHandler
     can be set up to be the owning parent object, which can can choose to simply
     delete the child object without rethrowing and killing the whole program. The
     GNet::Server and GNet::ClientPtr classes do this.
    </p>

    <p>
     Event sources in the event loop are typically held as a file descriptor and a
     windows event handle, together known as a <em>Descriptor</em>. Event loop
     implementations typically watch a set of Descriptors for events and call the
     relevant EventHandler/ExceptionHandler code via the <em>EventEmitter</em> class.
    </p>

    <p>
     EventState objects also contain a pointer to an EventLogging interface. This
     interface provides a string that describes some key attribute of the event
     handling object. EventLogging objects are arranged in a linked list that runs
     through the assemblage of event handling objects. Before delivering an event the
     EventEmitter combines the strings returned by this linked list and applies the
     result to the G::LogOutput singleton so that everything logged by the event
     handling code will have that prefix.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_7">Multi-threading</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:7:Multi-threading -->
    <p>
     Multi-threading is used only to make DNS lookup and external program execution
     asynchronous. A std::thread worker thread is used in a future/promise pattern to
     wrap up the <em>getaddrinfo()</em> and <em>waitpid()</em> system calls. The shared state
     comprises only the parameters and return results from these system calls, and
     synchronisation back to the main thread uses the main event loop (see
     <em>GNet::FutureEvent</em>).
    </p>

    <p>
     Multi-threading is also used in the Windows event loop once the number of
     handles goes above the WaitForMultipleObjects() limit.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_8">E-MailRelay GUI</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:8:E-MailRelay GUI -->
    <p>
     The optional GUI program <em>emailrelay-gui</em> uses the Qt toolkit for its user
     interface components. The GUI can run as an installer or as a configuration
     helper, depending on whether it can find an installation <em>payload</em>. Refer to
     the comments in <em>src/gui/guimain.cpp</em> for more details.
    </p>

    <p>
     The user interface runs as a stack of dialog-box pages with forward and back
     buttons at the bottom. Once the stack has been completed by the user then each
     page is asked to dump out its state as a set of key-value pairs (see
     <em>src/gui/pages.cpp</em>). These key-value pairs are processed by an installer class
     into a list of action objects (in the <em>Command</em> design pattern) and then the
     action objects are run in turn. In order to display the progress of the
     installation each action object is run within a timer callback so that the Qt
     framework gets a chance to update the display between each one.
    </p>

    <p>
     During development the user interface pages and the installer can be tested
     separately since the interface between them is a simple text stream containing
     key-value pairs.
    </p>

    <p>
     When run in configure mode the GUI normally ends up just editing the
     <em>emailrelay.conf</em> file (or <em>emailrelay-start.bat</em> on Windows) and/or the
     <em>emailrelay.auth</em> secrets file.
    </p>

    <p>
     When run in install mode the GUI expects to unpack all the E-MailRelay files
     from the payload into target directories. The payload is a simple directory
     tree that lives alongside the GUI executable or inside the Mac application
     bundle, and it contains a configuration file to tell the installer where
     to copy its files.
    </p>

    <p>
     When building the GUI program the library code shared with the main server
     executable is compiled separately so that different GUI-specific compiler
     options can be used. This is done as a 'unity build', using the pre-processor
     to concatenate the shared code into one source file and compiling that for the
     GUI. (This technique requires that private 'detail' namespaces are explicitly
     named rather than anonymous so that there cannot be any name clashes within the
     combined anonymous namespace.)
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_9">Character encoding on Windows</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:9:Character encoding on Windows -->
    <p>
     E-MailRelay on Windows generally holds all its internal strings in UTF-8,
     independent of the current active code page or locale. This is relevant mostly
     to file system paths, but also to event viewer output, configuration file
     contents, command-lines assembled to run external programs, system account
     information, registry paths and environment variables.
    </p>

    <p>
     The header file <em>gnowide.h</em> has inline functions that convert to and from UTF-8
     before calling the <em>wide</em> Windows API functions. The actual convertion between
     UTF-8 and UTF-16 wide characters is done by the G::Convert class. As a temporary
     measure the G_ANSI pre-processor switch can be defined to go back to using
     <em>ansi</em> functions.
    </p>

    <p>
     The G::Path class holds filesystem paths using UTF-8. Windows-specific source
     code, such as in <em>gfile_win32.cpp</em>, passes the UTF-8 strings to the <em>nowide</em>
     inline functions which in turn call wide runtime library functions like
     _wopen(). The exception is that the G::Path::iopath() method can be used to
     initialise std::fstreams directly, without using the <em>nowide</em> functions.
    </p>

    <p>
     The G::Arg class can be used to capture the Windows command-line in its wide
     form and then convert to UTF-8. The main() and WinMain() functions use the
     G::Arg::windows() factory function to do this.
    </p>

    <p>
     Configuration files are expected to use UTF-8 character encoding. The secrets
     file also notionally uses UTF-8, but Base64 or xtext encoding is used for the
     account details, so the encoding is less relevant there. The startup batch file
     (<em>emailrelay-start.bat</em>) necessarily uses the OEM code page and the E-MailRelay
     GUI now tries to ensure that the user's choice of install directory is
     compatible with this.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_10">Windows build</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:10:Windows build -->
    <p>
     E-MailRelay can be built for Windows using the native Visual Studio MSVC
     compiler or using MinGW (mingw-w64) on Linux.
    </p>

    <p>
     For active development use <em>winbuild.bat</em> to set up an environment that uses
     <em>cmake</em> and Visual Studio, or for one-off release builds use <em>winbuildall.bat</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
     The <em>winbuild.bat</em> script expects to find mbedtls source code in a child or
     sibling directory and Qt libraries under <em>c:\qt</em>, but refer to <em>winbuild.pm</em> for
     the details. The build proceeds using <em>cmake</em> and <em>cmake --build</em>, resulting in
     statically-linked executables but with the GUI typically dynamically-linked.
    </p>

    <p>
     The mbedtls code is built if necessary by running <em>cmake</em> and <em>cmake --build</em> in
     a <em>mbedtls-x64</em> build sub-directory. The mbedtls headers are copied into the
     mbedtls build tree. The mbedtls configuration header (mbedtls_config.h) is
     optionally edited to enable TLS v1.3. If necessary delete the <em>mbedtls-x64</em>
     build directory to trigger a rebuild.
    </p>

    <p>
     A release assembly can be created by running <em>winbuild-install.bat</em> or
     <em>perl winbuild.pl install</em>. This makes use of the Qt <em>windeployqt</em> utility to
     assemble DLLs and it also generates the Qt <em>.qm</em> translation files.
    </p>

    <p>
     For public release builds the E-MailRelay GUI must be statically linked. Start
     with a normal build with a dynamically-linked GUI and use <em>winbuild.pl install</em>
     to create the release assembly. Then use the <em>qtbuild.pl</em> perl script to build
     static Qt libraries from source in a location that <em>winbuild.pl</em> will find
     (or use <em>winbuildall.bat</em>). Rebuild so that the GUI is now statically linked and
     manually copy the statically-linked <em>emailrelay-gui.exe</em> binary into the release
     assembly, replacing <em>emailrelay-setup.exe</em> and <em>emailrelay-gui.exe</em>. Remove the
     now-redundant DLLs (in the both the root and payload directories) before
     zipping.
    </p>

    <p>
     For MinGW cross-builds use <em>./configure.sh -w64</em> and <em>make</em> on a Linux box and
     copy the built executables. Any extra run-time files can be identified by
     running <em>dumpbin /dependents</em> in the normal way.
    </p>

    <p>
     To target ancient versions of Windows start with a MinGW cross-build for 32-bit
     (<em>./configure.sh -m -w32 --disable-gui</em>). Then <em>winbuild.pl install_winxp</em> can
     be used to make a simplified distribution assembly, without a GUI.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_11">Windows packaging</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:11:Windows packaging -->
    <p>
     On Windows E-MailRelay is packaged as a zip file containing the files assembled
     by <em>winbuild.pl install</em> with a statically-built GUI copied in manually (see
     above).
    </p>

    <p>
     The setup program is the emailrelay GUI running in setup mode, with a <em>payload</em>
     directory containing the files to be installed. Refer to the comments in
     <em>src/gui/guimain.cpp</em> for more details.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_12">Unix build</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:12:Unix build -->
    <p>
     E-MailRelay uses autoconf and automake, but the <em>libexec/make2cmake</em> script can
     be used to generate cmake files. The generated cmake files incorporate some of
     the settings from the <em>configure</em> script, so run <em>configure</em> or <em>configure.sh</em>
     before <em>make2cmake</em>. The <em>configure</em> script is normally part of the release but
     it can itself be generated by running the <em>bootstrap</em> script.
    </p>

    <p>
     For a 'unity build' run <em>configure</em> (typically with compiler options passed via
     <em>CXXFLAGS</em>) and then <em>make unity</em>. Code-size optimisations such as <em>-Os</em> and
     <em>-fwhole-program</em> are particularly effective for a unity build. Refer to the
     comments in <em>unity/Makefile.am</em> for more information.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_13">Unix packaging</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:13:Unix packaging -->
    <p>
     On Unix-like operating systems the native packaging system is normally used
     rather than the E-MailRelay GUI installer, so the configure script should be
     given the <em>--disable-gui</em> command-line option.
    </p>

    <p>
     Top-level makefile targets <em>dist</em>, <em>deb</em> and <em>rpm</em> can be used to create a
     binary tarball, debian package, and RPM package respectively.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_14">Internationalisation</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:14:Internationalisation -->
    <p>
     The GUI code has i18n support using the Qt framework, with the tr() function
     used throughout the GUI source code. The GUI main() function loads translations
     from the <em>translations</em> sub-directory (relative to the executable), although
     that can be overridden with the <em>--qm</em> command-line option.
    </p>

    <p>
     The non-GUI code has some i18n support by using gettext() via the inline txt()
     and tx() functions defined in <em>src/glib/ggettext.h</em>. The configure script
     detects gettext support in the C run-time library, but without trying different
     compile and link options. See also <em>po/Makefile.am</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
     On Windows the main server executable <em>emailrelay.exe</em> has a tabbed dialog-box
     as its user interface, but that does not have any support for i18n.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_15">Source control</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:15:Source control -->
    <p>
     The source code is stored in the SourceForge <em>svn</em> and/or <em>git</em> repository.
    </p>

    <p>
     For example:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">

</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     Code that has been formally released will be tagged with a tag like <em>V_2_6</em>
     and any post-release or back-ported fixes will be on a <em>fixes</em> branch like
     <em>V_2_6_fixes</em>.
    </p>
