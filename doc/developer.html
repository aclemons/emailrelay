  <h1><a class="a-header" name="H_1">E-MailRelay Developer Guide</a></h1> <!-- index:1:H:1::E-MailRelay Developer Guide -->
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_1">Principles</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:1:Principles -->
    <p>
     The main principles in the design of E-MailRelay can be summarised as:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>Minimal third-party dependencies</li>
     <li>Windows/Unix portability without #ifdefs</li>
     <li>Event-driven, non-blocking, single-threaded networking code</li>
     <li>Functionality without imposing policy</li>
    </ul>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_2">Dependencies</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:2:Dependencies -->
    <p>
     E-MailRelay started life at a time when Linux had no decent package manager and
     Windows was in the grip of DLL hell. As a result, a key principle is that it
     has no dependencies other than a decent C++ runtime. Since that time OpenSSL
     has been introduced as a dependency to support TLS encryption, and the optional
     configuration and installation GUI has been developed using the Qt toolkit.
    </p>

    <p>
     In those early years multi-threading support in C++ libraries was poor, so up
     until version 2.0 the code was single-threaded throughout.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_3">Portability</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:3:Portability -->
    <p>
     The E-MailRelay code is mostly written in C++-1998, but using some features of
     C++-2011. A C++-1998 compiler can be used, but multi-threading will be disabled.
    </p>

    <p>
     The header files <em class="quote">gdef.h</em> in <em class="quote">src/glib</em> is used to fix up some compiler
     portability issues such as missing standard types, non-standard system headers
     etc. Conditional compilation directives (<em class="quote">#ifdef</em> etc.) are largely confined
     this file in order to improve readability.
    </p>

    <p>
     Windows/Unix portability is generally addressed by providing a common class
     declaration with two implementations. The implementations are put into separate
     source files with a <em class="quote">_unix</em> or <em class="quote">_win32</em> suffix, and if necessary a 'pimple' (or
     'Bridge') pattern is used to keep the o/s-specific details out of the header.
     If only small parts of the implementation are o/s-specific then there can be
     three source files per header. For example, <em class="quote">gsocket.cpp</em>, <em class="quote">gsocket_win32.cpp</em>
     and <em class="quote">gsocket_unix.cpp</em> in the <em class="quote">src/gnet</em> directory.
    </p>

    <p>
     Underscores in source file names are used exclusively to indicate build-time
     alternatives.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_4">Event model</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:4:Event model -->
    <p>
     The E-MailRelay server uses non-blocking socket i/o, with a select() event loop.
     This event model means that the server can handle multiple network connections
     simultaneously from a single thread, and even if multi-threading is disabled at
     build-time the only blocking occurs when external programs are executed (see
     <em class="quote">--filter</em> and <em class="quote">--address-verifier</em>).
    </p>

    <p>
     This event model can make the code more complicated than the equivalent
     multi-threaded approach since (for example) it is not possible to wait for a
     complete line of input to be received from a remote SMTP client because there
     might be other connections that need servicing half way through.
    </p>

    <p>
     The advantages of a non-blocking event model are discussed in the well-known
     <a class="a-href" href="http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html">C10K Problem</a> document.
    </p>

    <p>
     At higher levels the C++ slot/signal design pattern is used to propagate events
     between objects (not to be confused with operating system signals). The
     slot/signal implementation has been simplified compared to Qt or boost by not
     supporting signal multicasting, so each signal connects to no more than one
     slot.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_5">Module structure</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:5:Module structure -->
    <p>
     The main C++ libraries in the E-MailRelay code base are as follows:
    </p>

    <dl>
     <dt><em class="quote">glib</em></dt>
      <dd>
       Low-level classes for file-system abstraction, date and time representation,
       string utility functions, logging, command line parsing etc.
      </dd>
     <dt><em class="quote">gssl</em></dt>
      <dd>
       A thin layer over the third-party TLS libraries.
      </dd>
     <dt><em class="quote">gnet</em></dt>
      <dd>
       Network and event-loop classes.
      </dd>
     <dt><em class="quote">gauth</em></dt>
      <dd>
       Implements various authentication mechanisms.
      </dd>
     <dt><em class="quote">gsmtp</em></dt>
      <dd>
       SMTP protocol and message-store classes.
      </dd>
     <dt><em class="quote">gpop</em></dt>
      <dd>
       POP3 protocol classes.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
     All of these libraries are portable between Unix-like systems and Windows.
    </p>

    <p>
     Under Windows there is an additional library <em class="quote">win32</em> for the user interface.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_6">SMTP class structure</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:6:SMTP class structure -->
    <p>
     The message-store functionality uses three abstract interfaces: <em class="quote">MessageStore</em>,
     <em class="quote">NewMessage</em> and <em class="quote">StoredMessage</em>. The <em class="quote">NewMessage</em> interface is used to create
     messages within the store, and the <em class="quote">StoredMessage</em> interface is used for
     reading and extracting messages from the store. The concrete implementation
     classes based on these interfaces are respectively <em class="quote">FileStore</em>, <em class="quote">NewFile</em> and
     <em class="quote">StoredFile</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
     Protocol classes such as <em class="quote">GSmtp::ServerProtocol</em> receive network and timer
     events from their container and use an abstract <em class="quote">Sender</em> interface to send
     network data. This means that the protocols can be independent of the network
     and event loop framework.
    </p>

    <p>
     The interaction between the SMTP server protocol class and the message store is
     mediated by the <em class="quote">ProtocolMessage</em> interface. Two main implementations of this
     interface are available: one for normal spooling (<em class="quote">ProtocolMessageStore</em>), and
     another for immediate forwarding (<em class="quote">ProtocolMessageForward</em>). The <em class="quote">Decorator</em>
     pattern is used whereby the forwarding class uses an instance of the storage
     class to do the message storing and pre-processing, while adding in an instance
     of the <em class="quote">GSmtp::Client</em> class to do the forwarding.
    </p>

    <p>
     Message filtering (<em class="quote">--filter</em>) is implemented via an abstract <em class="quote">Filter</em>
     interface. Concrete implementations are provided for doing nothing, running an
     external executable program and talking to an external network server.
    </p>

    <p>
     The protocol, processor and message-store interfaces are brought together by the
     high-level <em class="quote">GSmtp::Server</em> and <em class="quote">GSmtp::Client</em> classes. Dependency injection is
     used to create the concrete instances of the <em class="quote">ProtocolMessage</em> and <em class="quote">Filter</em>
     interfaces.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_7">Event handling and exceptions</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:7:Event handling and exceptions -->
    <p>
     The use of non-blocking i/o in the network library means that most processing
     operates within the context of an i/o event or timeout callback, so the top
     level of the call stack is nearly always the event loop code. This can make
     catching C++ exceptions a bit awkward compared to a multi-threaded approach
     because it is not possible to put a single catch block around a particular
     high-level feature.
    </p>

    <p>
     The event loop delivers asynchronous socket events to the <em class="quote">EventHandler</em>
     interface, timer events to the <em class="quote">TimerBase</em> interface, and 'future' events to the
     <em class="quote">FutureEventCallback</em> interface. If any of the these event handlers throws an
     exception then the event loop will catch it and deliver it back to an exception
     handler through the <em class="quote">onException()</em> method of an associated <em class="quote">ExceptionHandler</em>
     interface. If an exception is thrown out of _this_ callback then the event loop
     code lets it propagate back to <em class="quote">main()</em>, typically terminating the program.
    </p>

    <p>
     Every pointer to an event callback interface is associated with an
     <em class="quote">ExceptionHandler</em>. The default <em class="quote">ExceptionHandler</em> is the <em class="quote">EventLoop</em>
     singleton, and a call to its <em class="quote">onException()</em> method terminates the event loop.
    </p>

    <p>
     This leads to a programming model where key objects are instantiated on the
     heap and these objects delete themselves when they receive certain events from
     the event loop. In the <em class="quote">GNet</em> library it is the <em class="quote">ServerPeer</em> and <em class="quote">HeapClient</em>
     classes that do this lifetime management; instances of these classes delete
     themselves when the associated network connection goes away and they
     implement the <em class="quote">ExceptionHandler</em> interface so that they schedule their own
     deletion when an exception is thrown.
    </p>

    <p>
     Special smart pointers are sometimes used for these self-deleting classes; the
     smart pointer does not delete the contained object when it is reset, it just
     tells the object to delete itself with a zero-length timer and then releases it
     for garbage collection.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_8">Multi-threading</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:8:Multi-threading -->
    <p>
     Multi-threading can be used as a build-time option to make DNS lookup and the
     execution of helper programs asynchronous; if std::thread is available then it
     is used in a future/promise pattern to wrap up <em class="quote">getaddrinfo()</em> and <em class="quote">waitpid()</em>
     system calls. The shared state comprises only the parameters and return results
     from these system calls, and synchronisation back to the main thread uses the
     event loop (see <em class="quote">GNet::FutureEvent</em>).
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_9">E-MailRelay GUI</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:9:E-MailRelay GUI -->
    <p>
     The optional GUI program <em class="quote">emailrelay-gui</em> uses the Qt toolkit for its user
     interface components. The GUI can run as an installer or as a configuration
     helper, depending on whether it can find an installation <em class="quote">payload</em>. Refer to
     the comments in <em class="quote">src/gui/guimain.cpp</em> for more details.
    </p>

    <p>
     The user interface runs as a stack of dialog-box pages with forward and back
     buttons at the bottom. Once the stack has been completed by the user then each
     page is asked to dump out its state as a set of key-value pairs (see
     <em class="quote">src/gui/pages.cpp</em>). These key-value pairs are processed by an installer class
     into a list of action objects (in the <em class="quote">Command</em> design pattern) and then the
     action objects are run in turn. In order to display the progress of the
     installation each action object is run within a timer callback so that the Qt
     framework gets a chance to update the display between each one.
    </p>

    <p>
     During development the user interface pages and the installer can be tested
     separately since the interface between them is a simple text stream containing
     key-value pairs.
    </p>

    <p>
     When run in configure mode the GUI normally ends up simply editing the
     <em class="quote">emailrelay.conf</em> file (or <em class="quote">emailrelay-start.bat</em> on Windows) and/or the
     <em class="quote">emailrelay.auth</em> secrets file.
    </p>

    <p>
     When run in install mode the GUI expects to unpack all the E-MailRelay files
     from the payload into target directories. (The payload used to be a single
     archive file appended to the executable, but it is now simple directory
     tree that lives alongside the GUI exectuable or inside the Mac application
     bundle.)
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_10">Windows packaging</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:10:Windows packaging -->
    <p>
     On Windows E-MailRelay is packaged as a zip file containing the executables
     (including the emailrelay GUI as <em class="quote">emailrelay-setup.exe</em>), documentation, and a
     <em class="quote">payload</em> directory tree. The payload contains many of the same files all over
     again, and while this duplication is not ideal it is at least straightforward.
    </p>

    <p>
     The Qt tool <em class="quote">windeployqt</em> is used to add run-time dependencies, such as the
     Qt DLLs.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_11">Unix packaging</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:11:Unix packaging -->
    <p>
     On Unix-like operating systems it is more natural to use some sort of package
     derived from the <em class="quote">make install</em> process rather than an installer program, so
     the emailrelay GUI is not normally used.
    </p>

    <p>
     Top-level makefile targets <em class="quote">dist</em>, <em class="quote">deb</em> and <em class="quote">rpm</em> can be used to create a
     binary tarball, a debian package, and an RPM package respectively.
    </p>
