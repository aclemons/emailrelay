E-MailRelay Windows
===================

Setup program
-------------
Installing E-MailRelay on Windows should be straightforward if you have
self-extracting archive program "emailrelay-setup.exe". Make sure that the
setup program is in a writeable directory with plenty of space on the disk
because when you run it it will extract an installation GUI program plus
dependent DLLs in into the same directory.

The installation GUI will take you through the installation options and then
install the run-time files into your chosen directory.

Manual installation
-------------------
In summary, the manual installation process for Windows for when you do not have
the self-extracting setup program, is as follows:
* Create a new program directory "Program Files\emailrelay"
* Unzip into "Program Files\emailrelay"
* Create a new spool directory "<windir>\spool\emailrelay"
* Create a new text file, eg. "c:\emailrelay.auth", to contain account details
* Add your ISP account details to "emailrelay.auth" with a line like "login client myaccount mypassword"
* Drag "emailrelay.exe" onto the desktop to create a shortcut for the server.
* Drag again to create a shortcut for the forwarding client.
* Add "--as-server --verbose" to the server shortcut properties.
* Add "--as-client myisp.net:smtp --hidden --client-auth c:/emailrelay.auth" to the client shortcut.

Move shortcuts to "Startup" folders as necessary.

Running as a service
--------------------
If you are installing manually you can set up E-MailRelay as a service so that
it starts up automatically at boot-time. You must first create a one-line batch
file called "emailrelay-start.bat" in the main E-MailRelay directory containing
the full E-MailRelay server command-line. Then just run
"emailrelay-service --install" to install the service.

When the E-MailRelay server is run in this way the "--no-daemon" and "--hidden"
switches are added automatically to whatever is in the "emailrelay-start" batch
file so that there is no user interface. (The "--no-daemon" switch changes the
interface from using the system-tray to using a normal window, and the
"--hidden" switch suppresses the window and any message boxes.)

Note that the batch file and the main E-MailRelay executable must be in the same
directory.

If you need to run multiple E-MailRelay services then pass a unique service name
and display name on the "emailrelay-service --install <name> <display-name>" 
command-line.

The service name you give is used to derive the name of the "<name>-start.bat"
batch file that contains the E-MailRelay server's command-line switches, so you
will need to create that first.

For example:
	copy emailrelay-start.bat emailrelay-client-start.bat
	edit emailrelay-client-start.bat
	emailrelay-service --install emailrelay-client "E-MailRelay Client"
	copy emailrelay-start.bat emailrelay-server-start.bat
	edit emailrelay-server-start.bat
	emailrelay-service --install emailrelay-server "E-MailRelay Server"

Diagnostics
-----------
E-MailRelay normally writes errors and warnings into the system event log, which
you can view by running "eventvwr.exe". You can increase the verbosity by adding
the "--verbose" switch to the E-MailRelay command-line, typically by editing the
"emailrelay-start.bat" batch script.

The E-MailRelay server also logs to the standard error stream. However, the
"--as-server" and "--as-proxy" switches implicitly incorporate "--close-stderr"
so with these switches the standard error logging will stop soon after startup.

To get continuous logging to a log file you should replace "--as-server" with
"--log" and "--as-proxy" with "--poll 0 --forward-to" and then use "2>" to
redirect the standard error stream, eg:

	"c:\program files\emailrelay\emailrelay.exe" --log -v -L ... > c:\temp.out 2>&1

The setup program may have already created a suitable batch file, so check for
that first and edit as necessary.

Testing with telnet
-------------------
The main user guide describes how to use telnet to help diagnose problems. In
recent versions of Windows you have to enable telnet by selecting "Telnet Client"
from "Programs and Features"->"Turn Windows features on or off" in the control
panel.

Building from source
--------------------
E-MailRelay can be compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio C++ (MSVC) 2008 or
MinGW, although the installation/configuration GUI can only be built with MinGW
because of its dependence on Qt.

There is a Visual Studio "solution" for MSVC 2008 in the "src" directory. For
MinGW please follow the guidelines in "mingw-common.mak" which is also in the
"src" directory.
