E-MailRelay Windows
===================

Setup program
-------------
Installing E-MailRelay on Windows should be straightforward if you have
self-extracting archive program "emailrelay-setup.exe". Make sure that the
setup program is in a writeable directory with plenty of space on the disk
because when you run it is will extract an installation GUI program plus
dependent DLLs in into the same directory.

The installation GUI program will take you through the installation options and
then install the run-time files into your chosen directory.

Manual installation
-------------------
In summary, the manual installation process for Windows for when you do not have
the self-extracting setup program, is as follows:
* Create a new program directory "Program Files\emailrelay"
* Unzip into "Program Files\emailrelay"
* Create a new spool directory "<windir>\spool\emailrelay"
* Create a new text file, eg. "c:\emailrelay.auth", to contain account details
* Add your ISP account details to "emailrelay.auth" with a line like "login client myaccount mypassword"
* Drag "emailrelay.exe" onto the desktop to create a shortcut for the server.
* Drag again to create a shortcut for the forwarding client.
* Add "--as-server --verbose" to the server shortcut properties.
* Add "--as-client myisp.net:smtp --hidden --client-auth c:/emailrelay.auth" to the client shortcut.

Move shortcuts to "Startup" folders as necessary.

Running as a service
--------------------
To manually install E-MailRelay as a service so that it starts up automatically
at boot-time you must first create a one-line batch file called
"emailrelay-start.bat" in the main E-MailRelay directory. This should contain
the full server startup command, including the "--hidden" and "--no-daemon"
switches. Then run "emailrelay-service --install" to install the service.
Note that the batch file and the main E-MailRelay executable must be in the same
directory.

Diagnostics
-----------
* Add "--log --log-time --verbose --syslog" to the E-MailRelay command-lines.
* Check the system event log (run "eventvwr.exe") for errors and warnings.
* Check the spool directory for ".bad" envelope files -- remove the suffix to retry.
* Set the environment variable "GLOGOUTPUT_DIR" to (eg.) "c:\temp" and look for "glog.txt"

Building from source
--------------------
E-MailRelay can be compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio C++ (MSVC) 6 or MinGW,
although the installation/configuration GUI can only be built with MinGW because
of its dependence on Qt.

There is a Visual Studio workspace file for MSVC 6 in the "src" directory. For
MinGW please follow the guidelines in "mingw-common.mak" which is also in the
"src" directory.
