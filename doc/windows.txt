E-MailRelay Windows installation
================================

Disclaimer
----------
E-MailRelay has been developed on Linux and the documentation relates to 
Unix-like operating systems rather than Microsoft Windows. This document
was written from the perspective of setting up E-MailRelay as a 
store-and-forward MTA on Windows NT and it may or may not be relevant to more 
up-to-date versions of Windows.

Quick start
------------
In summary, the Windows installation process is as follows:
* Create a new program directory "Program Files\emailrelay"
* Unzip into "Program Files\emailrelay"
* Create a new spool directory "<windir>\spool\emailrelay"
* Create a new text file, eg. "c:\emailrelay.auth", to contain account details
* Add your ISP account details with a line like "login client myaccount mypassword"
* Drag "emailrelay.exe" onto the desktop to create a shortcut for the server.
* Drag again to create a shortcut for the forwarding client.
* Add "--as-server --verbose" to the server shortcut properties.
* Add "--as-client myisp.net:smtp --hidden --client-auth c:/emailrelay.auth" to the client shortcut.

Move shortcuts to "Startup" folders as necessary. Or try using Microsoft's 
"srvany.exe" utility to run emailrelay as a service; you will need to use the 
"--hidden" and "--no-daemon" switches on the E-MailRelay command-line for this.

Diagnostics
-----------
* Set the environment variable "GLOGOUTPUT_FILE" to (eg.) "c:\emailrelay.log"
* Add "--log --log-time --verbose --syslog" to the E-MailRelay command-lines.
* Check the event log (run "eventwwr.exe") for errors and warnings.
* Check the spool directory for ".bad" envelope files -- remove the suffix to retry.
