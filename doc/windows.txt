E-MailRelay Windows installation
================================

Introduction
------------
E-MailRelay was originally developed on Linux and so most of the documentation 
relates to Unix-like operating systems rather than Microsoft Windows. This 
document provides some help on installing and setting up E-MailRelay as a
store-and-forward MTA on Windows 98.

Quick start
------------
In summary, the Windows installation process is as follows:
* Unpack the zip file to "Program Files\emailrelay".
* Create a spool directory under "<windir>\spool", eg.  "c:\win98\spool\emailrelay".
* Create a shortcut to the E-MailRelay executable in "Start->Programs->StartUp".
* Add "storage-daemon" configuration options such as "--as-server" to the "StartUp" shortcut's command line.
* Create a shortcut to the executable on the taskbar and/or desktop.
* Add "forwarding-client" configuration options such as "--as-client smtp.myisp.com:smtp" to the taskbar/desktop shortcut's command line.
* Configure your e-mail client (eg. Outlook) to use SMTP on the local machine for outgoing e-mail.
* Run the forwarding client from the taskbar/desktop shortcut once connected to the Internet.

These steps are described in more detail below.

On versions of Windows that support services you could also try using Microsoft's 
"srvany.exe" utility to run emailrelay as a service; you will need to add the 
"--hidden" and "--no-daemon" switches to the E-MailRelay command-line for this.

Unpacking
---------
To start the installation process you will need to extract the files from 
the "zip" archive. If you have "WinZip" installed then double-clicking on 
the E-MailRelay "zip" file should start WinZip and open the archive.

From WinZip you can press the "Extract" button, or use the "Actions->Extract" 
menu option. In the "Extract to" box you can type the full path of a new 
sub-directory under "Program Files" which will hold the extracted files, eg.
"C:\Program Files\emailrelay". WinZip will create the sub-directory 
("emailrelay") if necessary.

Server configuration
--------------------
Once the files are unpacked you need to create a shortcut to the E-MailRelay 
executable in the Start menu's "StartUp" folder. This will make sure that the 
E-MailRelay server is started automatically when you next boot the machine and 
log in.

One way to do this is to open up the "Program Files\emailrelay" folder using
Windows Explorer or "My Computer", and open a second folder window for the 
Start menu. To open thes second "Start menu" window: (1) right-click on a 
blank part of the taskbar, (2) select "Properties" from the popup menu, (3) 
select the "Start Menu Programs" tab, and (4) press the "Advanced..."
button. In the Start menu window go down into the "Programs" folder and then
into "StartUp". Then simply drag the "emailrelay.exe" file from one window 
to the other using the right mouse button. When you drop the file, select 
the "Create Shortcut Here" option on the pop-up menu.

You can then configure the E-MailRelay server by adding configuration options
to the shortcut's command line. The server should work okay without this step,
but there may be options you want to add. Refer to the userguide and reference
manual for more information on what configuration options are available.

To add configuration options right-click on the new shortcut which you have 
created in the "Start menu" window. Select "Properties" from the pop-up menu, 
and then select the "Shortcut" tab in the properties dialog box. The "Target" 
box should contain the name of the E-MailRelay executable. Add any additional 
configuration options after the executable name, separated by a space.

Client configuration
--------------------
Once the server is configured the next step is to create an icon on the desktop 
(or taskbar) which you can use to start the E-MailRelay forwarding client once 
you are connected to the Internet.

You can do this by simply dragging the E-MailRelay executable file from the
"Program Files\emailrelay" folder onto the desktop. Then right click on the new 
icon and select "Properties" from the pop-up menu. 

Again the "Target" box should contain the path of the E-MailRelay executable, 
and you should add configuration options at the end, separated by a space. As a 
minumum you will need to add "--as-client myisp:smtp", where "myisp" is replaced
with the hostname of your ISP's SMTP server.

Preparation
-----------
To complete the installation you should create a spool directory to hold your 
e-mail messages while you are off-line. By default E-MailRelay will look for a 
directory "<windir>\spool\emailrelay", where "<windir>" is the path of your main 
windows directory, typically "c:\win98" for Windows 98.

Finally you will need to configure your e-mail client program to use the local 
E-MailRelay server for outgoing mail. Where it asks for the name of the SMTP 
server for outgoing mail you should tell it to use "localhost" or "127.0.0.1".

Uninstall
---------
If you have ever registered the executable as a COM component, then deregister it 
using the "-unregserver" command-line switch. Then just delete the files under 
"Program Files\emailrelay" and "<windir>\spool\emailrelay", and remove any 
taskbar, desktop or "Start->Programs->StartUp" shortcuts.
