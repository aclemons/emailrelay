E-MailRelay Windows installation
================================

Setup program
-------------
Installing E-MailRelay on Windows should be straightfowrard if you have
self-extracting archive program "emailrelay-setup.exe". Make sure that the setup
program is in a writeable directory with plenty of space on the disk because
when you run it is will extract an installation GUI program plus dependent DLLs
in into the same directory.

The installation GUI program will take you through the installation options and
then install the run-time files into your chosen directory.

Manual installation
-------------------
In summary, the manual installation process for Windows for when you do not have
the self-extracting setup program, is as follows:
* Create a new program directory "Program Files\emailrelay"
* Unzip into "Program Files\emailrelay"
* Create a new spool directory "<windir>\spool\emailrelay"
* Create a new text file, eg. "c:\emailrelay.auth", to contain account details
* Add your ISP account details to "emailrelay.auth" with a line like "login client myaccount mypassword"
* Drag "emailrelay.exe" onto the desktop to create a shortcut for the server.
* Drag again to create a shortcut for the forwarding client.
* Add "--as-server --verbose" to the server shortcut properties.
* Add "--as-client myisp.net:smtp --hidden --client-auth c:/emailrelay.auth" to the client shortcut.

Move shortcuts to "Startup" folders as necessary. Or try using Microsoft's
"srvany.exe" utility to run emailrelay as a service; you will need to use the
"--hidden" and "--no-daemon" switches on the E-MailRelay command-line for this.

Diagnostics
-----------
* Set the environment variable "GLOGOUTPUT_DIR" to (eg.) "c:\temp" and look for "glog.txt"
* Add "--log --log-time --verbose --syslog" to the E-MailRelay command-lines.
* Check the event log (run "eventvwr.exe") for errors and warnings.
* Check the spool directory for ".bad" envelope files -- remove the suffix to retry.

Building from source
--------------------
E-MailRelay can be compiled using Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) 6 or MinGW,
although the installation/configuration GUI can only be built with MinGW because
of its dependence on Qt.

There is a workspace file for MSVC 6 in the "src" directory. For MinGW please
follow the guidelines in "mingw-common.mak" also in the "src" directory.
