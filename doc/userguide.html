   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_1">What is it?</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:1:What is it? -->
    <p>
     E-MailRelay is a lightweight SMTP store-and-forward mail server with POP access
     to spooled messages. It can be used as a personal internet mail server using
     SpamAssassin spam filtering and DNSBL connection blocking, with incoming e-mail
     delivered to maildir mailboxes. Store-and-forward operation is normally to a
     fixed smarthost but DNS MX routing can also be configured. External scripts can
     be used for address validation and for processing e-mail messages as they
     are received.
    </p>

    <p>
     E-MailRelay runs as a single process using the same non-blocking i/o model as
     Squid and nginx giving excellent scalability and resource usage.
    </p>

    <p>
     The code has few dependencies on third-party libraries or run-time environments
     so it is easy to build and install.
    </p>

    <p>
     E-MailRelay is designed to be policy-free, so that you can implement your own
     policies for message retries, bounces, local mailbox delivery, spam filtering
     etc. through external scripts.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_2">Basic operation</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:2:Basic operation -->
    <p>
     E-MailRelay can be run straight from the command-line, and on Windows you can
     run <em>emailrelay.exe</em> or <em>emailrelay-textmode.exe</em> from the zip file without
     going through the installation process.
    </p>

    <p>
     To use E-MailRelay in store-and-forward mode use the <em>--as-server</em> option to
     start the storage daemon in the background, and then do delivery of spooled
     messages by running with <em>--as-client</em>.
    </p>

<img src="serverclient.png" alt="image">


    <p>
     For example, to start a storage daemon in the background listening on port 10025
     use a command like this:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --as-server --port 10025 --spool-dir /tmp
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     On Windows use <em>c:/temp</em> for testing, rather than <em>/tmp</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
     Or to run it in the foreground:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --log --no-daemon --port 10025 --spool-dir /tmp
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     And then to forward the spooled mail to <em>smtp.example.com</em> run something
     like this:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --as-client smtp.example.com:25 --spool-dir /tmp
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     To forward continuously you can add the <em>--poll</em> and <em>--forward-to</em> options to
     the server command-line:
    </p>

<img src="forwardto.png" alt="image">


    <p>
     For example, this starts a server that also forwards spooled-up e-mail every
     minute:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --as-server --poll 60 --forward-to smtp.example.com:25
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     Or for a server that forwards each message as soon as it has been received, you
     can use <em>--forward-on-disconnect</em>:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --as-server --forward-on-disconnect --forward-to smtp.example.com:25
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     To edit or filter e-mail as it passes through the server specify your filter
     program with the <em>--filter</em> option, something like this:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --as-server --filter /tmp/set-from.js
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     Look for example filter scripts in the <em>examples</em> directory.
    </p>

    <p>
     E-MailRelay can also be used as a personal internet mail server:
    </p>

<img src="mailserver.png" alt="image">


    <p>
     Use <em>--remote-clients</em> (<em>-r</em>) to allow connections from outside the local
     network, define your domain name with <em>--domain</em> and use an address verifier as
     a first line of defense against spammers:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --as-server -v -r --domain=example.com --address-verifier=account:
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     Then enable POP access to the incoming e-mails with <em>--pop</em>, <em>--pop-port</em> and
     <em>--pop-auth</em>:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay ... --pop --pop-port 10110 --pop-auth /etc/emailrelay.auth
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     Set up the POP account with a user-id and password in the <em>--pop-auth</em> secrets
     file. The secrets file should contain a single line of text like this:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>server plain &lt;userid&gt; &lt;password&gt;
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     For more information on the command-line options refer to the reference guide
     or run:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --help --verbose</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_3">Configuration</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:3:Configuration -->
    <p>
     After a full installation the E-MailRelay server will normally be started up
     automatically when the machine boots up.
    </p>

    <p>
     On Unix-like systems the server will read its configuration settings from a file
     <em>/etc/emailrelay.conf</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
     On Windows E-MailRelay typically runs as a Windows Service and it reads its
     configuration from the startup batch file <em>emailrelay-start.bat</em> and/or
     the configuration file <em>emailrelay.cfg</em> in the <em>ProgramData/E-MailRelay</em>
     folder. (If you can't find this folder look for the <em>E-MailRelay</em> link in the
     <em>Program Files/E-MailRelay</em> folder and then right-click and "open file
     location".)
    </p>

    <p>
     You can change the E-MailRelay server configuration by editing the configuration
     file or startup batch file directly and then restarting the server. Or you can
     use the E-MailRelay configuration GUI if it is available.
    </p>

    <p>
     In many cases E-MailRelay will need to be configured with user-ids and
     passwords. For example, if e-mail is being forwarded to a <em>smarthost</em> for onward
     routing then you will need to supply the user-id and password for your account
     on the smarthost. These details must be entered into a <em>secrets</em> file and then
     one of <em>--server-auth</em>, <em>--client-auth</em> or <em>--pop-auth</em> must be used to point to
     the file.
    </p>

    <p>
     The E-MailRelay reference document describes the format of the secrets file.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_4">Logging</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:4:Logging -->
    <p>
     E-MailRelay is normally installed so that it logs its activity to a log file,
     but it can also send logging information to <em>syslog</em> on Unix systems or the to
     the Event Viewer on Windows.
    </p>

    <p>
     Logging is configured with options like <em>--log</em>, <em>--log-file</em>, <em>--as-server</em> and
     <em>--syslog</em>, so check these in the configuration file and/or startup batch file.
    </p>

    <p>
     For more verbose logging add the <em>--verbose</em> option. This is a good idea when
     setting up or trouble-shooting your E-MailRelay configuration.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_5">Failures and retries</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:5:Failures and retries -->
    <p>
     If e-mail messages cannot be forwarded by the E-MailRelay system then the
     envelope files in the spool directory are given a <em>.bad</em> suffix. The reason for
     the failure will be recorded in the envelope file itself.
    </p>

    <p>
     You should check for <em>.bad</em> envelope files in the E-MailRelay spool directory
     from time to time. If you want failed messages to be retried then just remove
     the <em>.bad</em> filename suffix. On Unix-like systems you can do this automatically
     with a cron job that runs the <em>emailrelay-resubmit.sh</em> script occasionally.
    </p>

    <p>
     Once a failed message has been renamed it will be forwarded along with all the
     others. It is a good idea to use regular polling (eg. <em>--poll=60</em>) to make sure
     that this happens in a timely manner.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_6">Open mail servers</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:6:Open mail servers -->
    <p>
     If you are running E-MailRelay as an internet mail server then you need to be
     careful about abuse by spammers and bot-nets. You will also need to be sure that
     incoming e-mail messages are never automatically routed back out to the internet
     because that will definitely attract abuse.
    </p>

    <p>
     By default an E-MailRelay server will only accept connections from local network
     addresses, so for an internet mail server you will need to add the
     <em>--remote-clients</em> option. When you add <em>--remote-clients</em> you should be
     sure that you have a firewall that blocks connections to any other ports that
     E-MailRelay might have open, or use the <em>--interface</em> option to limit their
     scope.
    </p>

    <p>
     A good first step in limiting abuse is to use an address verifier that checks
     that e-mails are correctly addressed to you. You can use the built-in address
     verifier called <em>account:</em> to do this or you can write your own verifier script.
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --as-server --remote-clients --address-verifier=account: --domain=mydomain.com
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     Refer to the <em>Address verifiers</em> section in the E-MailRelay reference document
     for more details.
    </p>

    <p>
     If you want to run an internet mail server that is not open to everyone then you
     can require that remote users authenticate themselves. Do this with a secrets
     file containing a user-id and password for every remote user, something like
     this:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>server plain user1 password1
server plain user2 password2
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     And then use <em>--server-auth</em> to point to the file:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --as-server --remote-clients --server-auth=/etc/emailrelay.auth
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     Refer to the <em>Authentication</em> section in the E-MailRelay reference document for
     more details.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_7">Running as a POP server</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:7:Running as a POP server -->
    <p>
     E-MailRelay can run as a POP server so that an e-mail client program can
     retrieve messages from the E-MailRelay spool directory.
    </p>

    <p>
     To allow POP access use the <em>--pop</em> and <em>--pop-auth</em> command-line options,
     something like this:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --as-server --pop --pop-auth=/etc/pop.auth
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     You will need to create the <em>--pop-auth</em> secrets file. It should contain one
     line of text that gives the username and password that your e-mail client will
     use when connecting to E-MailRelay, for example:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>server plain user1 password1
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     If you are using POP to view a spool directory that is also being used for
     e-mail forwarding then you should use <em>--pop-no-delete</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
     If using more than one e-mail client program then you might want to make
     independent copies of your e-mails for each client. Use a <em>--filter</em> program to
     copy the e-mail files into sub-directories of the main spool directory and then
     use <em>--pop-by-name</em> so that each e-mail client accesses its own sub-directory
     according to which account name it used when authenticating. The filter can be
     an external program, or just use the built-in <em>copy:</em> filter.
    </p>

<img src="popbyname.png" alt="image">

   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_8">IMAP</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:8:IMAP -->
    <p>
     E-MailRelay does not support the IMAP protocol directly but a simple filter
     script can be used to move e-mails into a <em>maildir</em> directory and an IMAP server
     such as <em>dovecot</em> can be used to serve them from there.
    </p>

    <p>
     It is normally sufficient for a filter script to just move the E-MailRelay
     content file straight into the mailbox <em>cur</em> directory, delete the corresponding
     envelope file and then exit with an exit code of 100. The built-in <em>deliver:</em>
     filter can be used to do this.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_9">Triggering delivery</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:9:Triggering delivery -->
    <p>
     If you are using E-MailRelay on a Linux/Unix system to store and forward e-mail
     over an intermittent link to the internet such as dial-up or wireless
     networking, then you might need to arrange for E-MailRelay to be notified when
     it can start forwarding e-mail.
    </p>

    <p>
     You should find that there are special directories where you can install your
     own hook scripts that are called whenever a dial-up or wireless network
     connection is established. For dial-up this might be <em>/etc/ppp/ip-up.d</em>, and for
     wireless <em>/etc/network/if-up.d</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
     Just create a two-line script like this in the relevant directory:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>#!/bin/sh
exec /usr/sbin/emailrelay --as-client=smtp.example.com:smtp
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     and make it executable using <em>chmod +x</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
     You can also trigger forwarding from the E-MailRelay server via the <em>--admin</em>
     interface.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_10">Rate limiting</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:10:Rate limiting -->
    <p>
     If you need to slow the rate at which e-mails are forwarded you can use a
     <em>--client-filter</em> program to introduce a delay. On Windows this JavaScript
     filter program would give you a delay of a minute:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>WScript.Sleep( 60000 ) ;
WScript.Quit( 0 ) ;
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     However, this can cause timeouts at the server, so a better approach is to use
     <em>--client-filter exit:102</em> so that only one e-mail message is forwarded on each
     polling cycle, and then use <em>--poll 60</em> to limit it to one e-mail per minute.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_11">SpamAssassin</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:11:SpamAssassin -->
    <p>
     The E-MailRelay server can use <a href="http://spamassassin.apache.org">SpamAssassin</a>
     to mark or reject potential spam.
    </p>

    <p>
     It's easiest to run SpamAssassin's <em>spamd</em> program in the background and let
     E-MailRelay send incoming messages to it over the local network.
    </p>

    <p>
     The built-in <em>spam-edit:</em> filter is used to pass e-mail messages to spamd:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --as-server --filter=spam-edit:127.0.0.1:783
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     If SpamAssassin detects a message is spam it will edit it into a spam report
     with the original e-mail moved into an attachment.
    </p>

    <p>
     Alternatively use the <em>spam:</em> filter if spam e-mails should be rejected
     outright:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --as-server --filter=spam:127.0.0.1:783</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_12">Google mail</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:12:Google mail -->
    <p>
     To send mail via Google mail's SMTP gateway you will need to obtain a new
     <em>application password</em> from Google: log in to your Google account and look for
     the account's security settings and then <em>app passwords</em>. Create the password
     for E-MailRelay selecting an application type <em>other</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
     Then create a client secrets file for E-MailRelay containing your account name
     and the new application password. You may already have this file on Windows as
     <em>C:\ProgramData\E-MailRelay\emailrelay.auth</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
     You should edit the secrets file to contain one <em>client</em> line, something like
     this:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>client plain myname@gmail.com myapppassword
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     Then change the E-MailRelay configuration file to refer to your secrets file by
     using the <em>--client-auth</em> option.
    </p>

    <p>
     Also set the <em>--as-proxy</em> or <em>--forward-to</em> option to <em>smtp.gmail.com:587</em> and
     add <em>--client-tls</em> to enable TLS encryption.
    </p>

    <p>
     On Windows your settings might look something like this in the <em>emailrelay.cfg</em>
     configuration file:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>forward-to smtp.gmail.com:587
client-tls
client-auth C:/ProgramData/E-MailRelay/emailrelay.auth
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     In the startup batch file (<em>emailrelay-start.bat</em>) they should all go on one
     line:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>start ... emailrelay --as-proxy=smtp.gmail.com:587 --client-tls --client-auth=C:/ProgramData/E-MailRelay/emailrelay.auth ...</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_13">Connection tunnelling</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:13:Connection tunnelling -->
    <p>
     E-MailRelay can send mail out via a SOCKS v4 proxy, which makes it easy to route
     your mail through an encrypted tunnel created by <em>ssh -N -D</em> or via the Tor
     anonymising network.
    </p>

    <p>
     For example, this will run an E-MailRelay proxy on port 587 that routes via a
     local Tor server on port 9050 to the mail server at smtp.example.com:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --port 587 --as-proxy=smtp.example.com:25@localhost:9050 --domain=anon.net --anonymous --connection-timeout=300</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_14">Blocklists and dynamic firewalls</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:14:Blocklists and dynamic firewalls -->
    <p>
     E-MailRelay can consult with remote DNSBL blocklist servers in order to block
     incoming connections from known spammers. For example:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay -r --dnsbl=zen.spamhaus.org,bl.mailspike.net ...
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     Refer to the documentation of the <em>--dnsbl</em> option for more details.
    </p>

    <p>
     It is also possible to integrate E-MailRelay with intrusion detection systems
     such as <em>fail2ban</em> that monitor log files and dynamically modify your iptables
     firewall. Use E-MailRelay's <em>--log-format=address</em> command-line option so that
     the remote IP addresses are logged and made visible to <em>fail2ban</em>.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_15">Bcc handling</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:15:Bcc handling -->
    <p>
     E-MailRelay transfers e-mail messages without changing their content in any way,
     other than by adding a <em>Received</em> header. In particular, if a message contains a
     <em>Bcc:</em> header when it is submitted to the E-MailRelay server it will have the
     same <em>Bcc:</em> header when forwarded.
    </p>

    <p>
     It is normally the responsibility of the program that submits an e-mail message
     to submit it separately for each <em>Bcc</em> recipient, removing the <em>Bcc:</em> header
     from the message content or changing it to contain only the 'current' recipient.
     If this is not done, perhaps through misconfiguration of the e-mail user agent
     program, then <em>Bcc</em> recipients may be visible to the <em>To</em> and <em>Cc</em> message
     recipients.
    </p>

    <p>
     An E-MailRelay <em>--filter</em> script can be used to reject messages with incorrect
     <em>Bcc:</em> headers, and an example script is included.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_16">Advanced set-up</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:16:Advanced set-up -->

    <p>
     This is a three-in-one configuration so there are effectively three E-MailRelay
     servers running in one process, named <em>in</em>, <em>out</em> and <em>other</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
     The <em>in</em> server is an internet-facing e-mail server with delivery to individual
     mailboxes that can be accessed via POP. The <em>account:</em> verifier checks the
     addressees in the incoming e-mails against the list of accounts on the local
     machine and against the given domain name; the IP address of the network
     connection is checked against a DNSBL database; SpamAssassin is used to
     identify spam; and Linux PAM is used for POP authentication.
    </p>

    <p>
     The <em>out</em> server is a routing MTA that sends outgoing e-mail messages directly
     to destination servers. The filter makes copies so that each e-mail message goes
     to just one domain. The client filter uses DNS MX queries against the local
     system's default name servers to do the routing. If any e-mail messages are
     addressed to local users they are short-circuited and delivered directly to
     their <em>in</em> mailboxes.
    </p>

    <p>
     The <em>other</em> server does store-and-forward to a gmail smarthost and acts as the
     default destination for the <em>out</em> server. In this example the gmail password is
     given directly on the command-line but it is normally more secure to use a
     separate secrets file.
