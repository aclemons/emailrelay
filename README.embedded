E-MailRelay on embedded systems
===============================

OpenWRT
-------
The OpenWRT system provides an excellent framework for cross-compiling
E-MailRelay to run on embedded systems.

An OpenWRT Makefile for E-MailRelay can be found in the "extra/openwrt" 
directory. Install it in the OpenWrt tree as package/emailrelay/Makefile.
