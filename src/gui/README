E-MailRelay GUI
===============

Overview
--------
Typically on Unix the GUI is used for configuration. It is installed as a shell 
script wrapper that defines the install directories, and a ".real" binary that 
is executed by the wrapper.

Typically on Windows the GUI is a self-extracting installer, with the complete 
distribution packed into the one executable. Once it extracts itself into a 
temporary directory the GUI runs as an installer, requiring the user to specify 
a target directory to install into and then copying and configuring into that 
location. 

The GUI running as an installer also installs itself so that it can be re-run
as a configuration utility.

Refer to the comments in guimain.cpp for more information.

Building
--------
When building the E-MailRelay GUI you may need to set the "PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
environment variable to point to the ".pc" files in the Qt "lib" directory and
set the "e_qtmoc" configure variable to point to the Qt "moc" utility. You
may also need to set the correct library directory for Qt if it is wrong in
the ".pc" file by setting "LDFLAGS":

	export QT=/usr/local/qt4
	LDFLAGS=-L$QT/lib PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$QT/lib ./configure --enable-gui e_qtmoc="$QT/bin/moc"
