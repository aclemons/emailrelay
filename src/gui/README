E-MailRelay GUI
===============

Overview
--------
The E-MailRelay GUI can act as an installer for self-extracting pacakges or as a
configuration utility.

For more information refer to the developer document (doc/developer.txt) and 
comments in guimain.cpp.

Building
--------
When building the E-MailRelay GUI you may need to set the "PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
environment variable to point to the ".pc" files in the Qt "lib" directory and
set the "e_qtmoc" configure variable to point to the Qt "moc" utility. You
may also need to set the correct library directory for Qt if it is wrong in
the ".pc" file by setting "LDFLAGS":

	export QT=/usr/local/qt4
	LDFLAGS=-L$QT/lib PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$QT/lib ./configure --enable-gui e_qtmoc="$QT/bin/moc"
