E-MailRelay GUI
===============

Overview
--------
The E-MailRelay GUI can act as an installer for self-extracting pacakges or as a
configuration utility.

For more information refer to the developer document (doc/developer.txt) and
comments in guimain.cpp.

Building
--------
When building the E-MailRelay GUI on unix-like operating systems you may need to
set the "PKG_CONFIG_PATH" environment variable to point to the ".pc" files in
the Qt "lib" directory, and set the "e_qtmoc" configure variable to point to the
Qt "moc" utility. You may also need to set the correct library directory for Qt
if it is wrong in the ".pc" file by setting "LDFLAGS":

	export QT=/usr/local/qt5
	LDFLAGS=-L$QT/lib PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$QT/lib ./configure --enable-gui e_qtmoc="$QT/bin/moc"
