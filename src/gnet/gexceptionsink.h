//| \class GNet::ExceptionSink
/// A tuple containing an ExceptionHandler interface pointer and
/// a bound 'exception source' pointer.
///
/// The EventEmitter and TimerList classes associate an
/// event handler and ExceptionSink with each event source
/// (file descriptor or timer). If the event handler throws
/// an exception then the associated ExceptionHandler's
/// onException() method is called, via ExceptionSink::call().
///
/// An onException() implementation normally just rethrows the
/// exception to terminate the event loop, but sometimes the
/// exception can be handled less drastically, perhaps by
/// deleting the object identified as the exception source.
///
/// For example, Server objects create and contain ServerPeer
/// objects:
///
/// \code
/// class ServerPeer : public ExceptionSource { ... } ;
/// class Server : private ExceptionHandler
/// {
///    void init() { m_peer = newServerPeer(...) ; }
///    void onException( ExceptionSource * source ... ) override
///    {
///        assert( source == m_peer ) ;
///        delete source ;
///    }
///    ServerPeer * m_peer ;
/// } ;
/// \endcode
///
/// The ExceptionSinkUnbound class is used as a device to force
/// factory methods to plumb-in an ExceptionSource pointer to
/// the newly-created object as soon as its address is available
/// (ie. before the constructor body runs).
///
/// \code
/// class FooServerPeer : public ServerPeer
/// {
/// public:
///     FooServerPeer * newServerPeer( ExceptionSinkUnbound esu , ... ) override
///     {
///         return new FooServerPeer( esu , ... ) ;
///     }
/// private:
///     FooServerPeer( ExceptionSinkUnbound esu , ... ) :
///        ServerPeer( esu.bind(this) , ... )
///     {
///     }
/// } ;
/// \endcode
///
/// So then the ServerPeer constructor has a bound ExceptionSink that
/// it can pass to its timers and other event-handling objects:
///
/// \code
/// ServerPeer::ServerPeer( ExceptionSink es , ... ) :
///    m_timer(*this,...,es) ,
///    m_other(es,...)
/// {
/// }
/// \endcode
