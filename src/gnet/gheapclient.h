/// A SimpleClient class for objects that manage their own
/// lifetime on the heap. Note that this class automatically starts 
/// connecting after construction using a zero-length timer, so
/// there is no need to call the base class's connect() method.
/// The doDelete() method starts another zero-length timer in
/// order to delete the instance once the stack has unwound.
///
/// Note that most errors and exceptions result in HeapClient objects 
/// deleting themselves. This is similar to the way the ServerPeer 
/// class works on the server side. Exceptions thrown out of event
/// loop callbacks result in the relevant HeapClient object deleting 
/// itself. This means that the connection gets destroyed without 
/// terminating the application. However, if a second nested exception
/// is thrown out of (eg.) onDelete() then the event loop will 
/// terminate.
