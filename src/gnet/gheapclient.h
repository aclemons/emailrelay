/// \class GNet::HeapClient
/// A SimpleClient class for client objects that manage their own lifetime on
/// the heap.
///
/// HeapClients are instantiated on the heap and should be deleted by calling
/// their doDelete() method. The doDelete() implementation starts a zero-length
/// timer which does "delete this" when it expires, so it is safe to call
/// doDelete() from within event callbacks.
///
/// This class automatically starts connecting after construction using a
/// zero-length timer, so there is no need to call the base class's connect()
/// method.
///
/// When the event loop delivers an event callback to a HeapClient and the
/// HeapClient throws a std::exception back up to the event loop the event loop
/// calls the HeapClient again via onException(). The implementation of
/// onException() in HeapClient causes the HeapClient to self-destruct.
/// As a result, the client code can just throw an exception to terminate
/// the connection and delete itself.
