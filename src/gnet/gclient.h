/// derived classes: onConnect(), onReceive(), onDelete(), and
/// onSendComplete().
///
/// The intention is that derived classes use the virtual functions
/// for event notification while the slot/signal event notifications
/// are used by the containing object (in particular so that the
/// container is informed when the client object deletes itself).
