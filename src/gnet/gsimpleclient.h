/// The class handles name-to-address resolution, deals with connection issues, 
/// reads incoming data, and manages flow-control when sending. The implementation 
/// uses the SocketProtocol class in order to do TLS/SSL; see sslConnect().
///
/// Name-to-address lookup is performed if the supplied ResolverInfo object
/// does not contain an address. This can be done synchronously or asynchronously.
/// The results of the lookup can be obtained via the resolverInfo() method
/// and possibly fed back to the next SimpleClient that connects to the same
/// host/service in order to implement name lookup cacheing (see GNet::ClientPtr).
/// However, most operating systems implement their own name lookup cacheing,
/// so this is not terribly useful in practice.
