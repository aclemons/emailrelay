//| \class GNet::TimerList
/// A singleton which maintains a list of all Timer objects, and interfaces
/// to the event loop on their behalf.
///
/// Event loops should call TimerList::interval() to determine how long to
/// wait before the first Timer goes off. If the timed-wait times-out or
/// if the interval was zero then they must call TimerList::doTimeouts().
///
/// There can be a race where this class incorrectly sees no expired timers
/// in doTimeouts() if, for example, the system clock is being stretched.
/// However, the interval() or setTimer() time will be very small and the
/// race will resolve itself naturally.
///
/// Every timer has an associated exception handler, typically a
/// more long-lived object that has the timer as a sub-object.
/// If the timer callback throws an exception then timer list catches
/// it and invokes the exception handler -- and if that throws then the
/// exception escapes the event loop. This is safe even if the exception
/// handler object is destroyed by the original exception because the
/// exception handler base-class destructor uses the timer list's disarm()
/// mechanism. This is the same behaviour as in the EventHandlerList.
///
/// Exception handlers are combined with an additional 'source' pointer
/// in an ExceptionSink tuple. The source pointer can be used to
/// provide additional information to the exception handler, typically
/// as a pointer to the event handler (sic) object.
///
/// The implementation maintains a pointer to the timer that will
/// expire soonest so that interval() is fast and O(1) when the set
/// of timers is stable and most events are non-timer events.
///
/// Zero-length timers expire in the same order as they were started,
/// which allows them to be used as a mechanism for asynchronous
/// message-passing.
