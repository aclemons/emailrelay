/// A 'future' object for asynchronous name resolution, in practice holding

/// collected by the main thread with get() once the run() has finished.

/// Signalling completion from worker thread to main thread is out of scope
/// for this class; see GNet::FutureEvent.

/// Eg:
/// \code
///
/// ResolverFuture f( "example.com" , "smtp" , AF_INET , false ) ;
/// std::thread t( &ResolverFuture::run , f ) ;
/// ...
/// t.join() ;
/// Address a = f.get().first ;
/// if( f.error() ) throw std::runtime_error( f.reason() ) ;
/// \endcode
