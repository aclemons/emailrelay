/// A 'future' shared-state class for asynchronous name resolution that
/// holds parameters and results of a call to getaddrinfo(), as performed
/// by the run() method.
///
/// The run() method can be called from a worker thread and the results
/// collected by the main thread using get() once the worker thread has
/// signalled that it has finished. The signalling mechanism is outside
/// the scope of this class (see GNet::FutureEvent).
///
/// Eg:
/// \code
///
/// ResolverFuture f( "example.com" , "smtp" , AF_INET , false ) ;
/// std::thread t( &ResolverFuture::run , f ) ;
/// ...
/// t.join() ;
/// Address a = f.get().first ;
/// if( f.error() ) throw std::runtime_error( f.reason() ) ;
/// \endcode
