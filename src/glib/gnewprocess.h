			///< Constructor. Spawns the given program to run independently in a
			///< child process.
			///<
			///< The parent process can capture the child process's stdout or
			///< stderr (ie. stdxxx) by redirecting it to an internal pipe going
			///< from child to parent. The stdxxx parameter is 1 for stdout,
			///< 2 for stderr or 0 for neither.
			///<
			///< The child process is optionally given a clean, minimalist
			///< environment.
			///<
			///< If 'strict_path' then the program must be given as an absolute path.
			///< Otherwise it can be relative and the PATH environment is used
			///< to find it. (The PATH search is done after the environment has
			///< been either cleaned or not.)
			///<
			///< If a valid identity is supplied then the child process runs as
			///< that identity. If 'strict_id' is also true then the id is not
			///< allowed to be root. See Process::beOrdinaryForExec().
			///<
			///< If the exec() fails then the 'exec_error_exit' argument is used as
			///< the child process exit code.
			///<
			///< By default the child process runs with stdin and stderr attached to
			///< the null device and stdout attached to the internal pipe.
			///<
			///< The internal pipe can be used for error messages in the situation
			///< where the exec() in the forked child process fails. This requires
			///< that one of the 'exec_error_format' parameters is given; by default
			///< nothing is sent over the pipe when the exec() fails.
			///<
			///< The exec error message is assembled by the given callback function,
			///< with the 'exec_error_format' argument passed as its first parameter.
			///< The second parameter is the exec() errno. The default callback
			///< function does text substitution for "__errno__" and "__strerror__"
			///< substrings that appear within the error format string.
