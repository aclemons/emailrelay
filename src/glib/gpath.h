//| \class G::Path
/// A Path object represents a file system path. The class is concerned with
/// path syntax, not file system i/o.
///
/// A full path is made up of a root, a set of directories, and a filename. The
/// posix root is just a forward slash, but on Windows the root can be complex,
/// possibly including non-splitting separator characters. The filename may have
/// an extension part, which is to the right of the right-most dot.
///
/// The path separator is used between directories and filename, but only
/// between the root and the first directory if the root does not itself end in
/// a separator character.
///
/// A windows drive-letter root may end with a separator character or not; if
/// there is no separator character at the end of the drive-letter root then
/// the path is relative to the drive's current working directory.
///
/// Path components of "." are ignored by simple(), basename(), and dirname().
/// Path components of ".." are retained but can be eliminated if they are
/// collapsed(). Path components of "." are eliminated by split(), except
/// in the degenerate case.
///
/// This class is agnostic on the choice of UTF-8 or eight-bit characters since
/// the delimiters are all seven-bit ascii.
///
/// Both posix and windows behaviours are available at run-time; the default
/// behaviour is the native behaviour, but this can be overridden, typically
/// for testing purposes.
///
/// The posix path separator character is the forward-slash; on Windows it is a
/// back-slash, but with all forward-slashes converted to back-slashes
/// immediately on input.
