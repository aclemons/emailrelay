/// A class which acquires the process's special privileges on construction

/// privileges are not necessarily root privileges; they can be suid privileges.
///
/// The class must be initialised by calling a static init() method. If instances
/// are nested then the inner instances have no effect.
///
/// The effect of this class depends on whether the process's real-id is root
/// or not. If the real-id is root then the effective-id is switched to
/// some named 'ordinary' user's id at startup, and then back to what it
/// was (ie. root or the suid id) for the critical sections.  Otherwise,
/// the effective-id is switched to the real-id at startup and switched back
/// to what it was for the critical sections.
///
/// The implementation uses G::Process and G::Identity.
