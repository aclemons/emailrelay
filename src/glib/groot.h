/// A class which acquires the process's special privileges on construction
/// and releases them on destruction. Despite the name of the class the special
/// privileges are not necessarily root privileges; they can be suid privileges.
///
/// The class must be initialised by calling a static init() method. If instances
/// are nested then the inner instances have no effect.
///
/// The effect of this class depends on whether the process's real-id is root
/// or not. If the real-id is root then the effective-id is switched to
/// some named 'ordinary' user's id at startup, and then back to what it
/// was (ie. root or the suid-id) for the critical sections. Otherwise,
/// in the case of a suid binary not run by root, the privileged effective-id
/// is switched to the real-id at startup and switched back for the critical
/// sections (although the switching back does rely on the saved-suid-id
/// mechanism, POSIX_SAVED_IDS).
///
/// The implementation uses G::Process and G::Identity.
