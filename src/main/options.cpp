			// terminates.

		"d!as-server!runs as a server, storing mail in the spool directory!: equivalent to \"--log --close-stderr\"!0!!1|"
			// This is equivalent to --log and --close-stderr. It is a convenient way
			// of running a background storage daemon that accepts mail messages and

		"p!port!specifies the SMTP listening port number (default is 25)!!1!port!2|"
			//default: 25
			//example: 587
			// Sets the port number used for listening for incoming SMTP connections.

		"r!remote-clients!allows remote clients to connect!!0!!2|"
			// Allows incoming connections from addresses that are not local. The
			// default behaviour is to ignore connections that are not local in
			// order to prevent accidental exposure to the public internet, but
			// a firewall should also be used. The definition of 'local' is
			// different for IPv4 and IPv6.

		"s!spool-dir!specifies the spool directory!!1!dir!2|"
			//example: /var/spool/emailrelay

			// certificate.

		"!server-tls-required!mandatory use of TLS before SMTP server authentication or mail-to! (requires --server-tls)!0!!3|"
			// Makes the use of TLS mandatory for any incoming SMTP and POP connections.
			// SMTP clients must use the STARTTLS command to establish a TLS session
			// before they can issue SMTP AUTH or SMTP MAIL-TO commands.

		"!server-tls-certificate!specifies a private TLS key+certificate file for --server-tls!!1!pem-file!3|"
			//example: /etc/ssl/certs/emailrelay.pem
			//example: C:/ProgramData/E-MailRelay/emailrelay.pem
			// Defines the TLS certificate file when acting as a SMTP or POP server.
			// This file must contain the server's private key and certificate chain
			// using the PEM file format. Keep the file permissions tight to avoid
			// accidental exposure of the private key.

		"!server-tls-verify!enables verification of remote client's certificate! against CA certificates in the given file or directory!1!ca-list!3|"
			//example: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
			//example: C:/ProgramData/E-MailRelay/ca-certificates.crt
			// Enables verification of remote SMTP and POP clients' certificates
			// against any of the trusted CA certificates in the specified file
			// or directory. In many use cases this should be a file containing
			// just your self-signed root certificate.

		"j!client-tls!enables negotiated TLS when acting as an SMTP client! (ie. STARTTLS)!0!!3|"
			// Enables negotiated TLS for outgoing SMTP connections; the SMTP
			// STARTTLS command will be issued if the remote server supports it.

		"b!client-tls-connection!enables SMTP over TLS for SMTP client connections!!0!!3|"
			// Enables the use of a TLS tunnel for outgoing SMTP connections.
			// This is for SMTP over TLS (SMTPS), not TLS negotiated within SMTP

			//example: smtp.example.com
			// Enables verification of the CNAME within the remote SMTP server's certificate.

		"!client-tls-server-name!includes the server hostname in the tls handshake! (ie. server name identification)!1!hostname!3|"
			//example: smtp.example.com
			// Defines the target server hostname in the TLS handshake. With
			// --client-tls-connection this can be used for SNI, allowing the remote
			// server to adopt an appropriate identity.

		"!client-tls-required!mandatory use of TLS for SMTP client connections! (requires --client-tls)!0!!3|"
			// Makes the use of TLS mandatory for outgoing SMTP connections. The SMTP
			// STARTTLS command will be used before mail messages are sent out.
			// If the remote server does not allow STARTTLS then the SMTP connection
			// will fail.

		"9!tls-config!sets low-level TLS configuration options! (eg. tlsv1.2)!1!options!3|"
			//example: mbedtls,tlsv1.2
			// Selects and configures the low-level TLS library, using a comma-separated
			// list of keywords. If OpenSSL and mbedTLS are both built in then keywords
			// of "openssl" and "mbedtls" will select one or the other. Keywords like
			// "tlsv1.0" can be used to set a minimum TLS protocol version, or
			// "-tlsv1.2" to set a maximum version.

		"g!debug!generates debug-level logging if built in!!0!!3|"
			// Enables debug level logging, if built in. Debug messages are usually
			// only useful when cross-referenced with the source code and they may
			// expose plaintext passwords and mail message content.

		"C!client-auth!enables SMTP authentication with the remote server, using the given client secrets file!!1!file!3|"
			//example: /etc/emailrelay.auth
			//example: C:/ProgramData/E-MailRelay/emailrelay.auth
			// Enables SMTP client authentication with the remote server, using the
			// client account details taken from the specified secrets file. The
			// secrets file should normally contain one line that starts with "client"
			// and that line should have between four and five space-separated
			// fields; the second field is the password encoding ("plain" or "md5"),
			// the third is the user-id and the fourth is the password. The user-id
			// is RFC-1891 xtext encoded, and the password is either xtext encoded
			// or generated by "emailrelay-passwd". If the remote server does not
			// support SMTP authentication then the SMTP connection will fail.

		"L!log-time!adds a timestamp to the logging output!!0!!3|"
			// Adds a timestamp to the logging output using the local timezone.

		"N!log-file!log to file instead of stderr! (with '%d' replaced by the current date)!1!file!3|"
			//example: /var/log/emailrelay-%d
			//example: C:/ProgramData/E-MailRelay/log-%d.txt
			// Redirects standard-error logging to the specified file. Logging to
			// the log file is not affected by --close-stderr. The filename can
			// include "%d" to get daily log files; the "%d" is replaced by the
			// current date in the local timezone using a "YYYYMMDD" format.

		"S!server-auth!enables authentication of remote SMTP clients, using the given server secrets file!!1!file!3|"
			//example: /etc/private/emailrelay.auth
			//example: C:/ProgramData/E-MailRelay/emailrelay.auth
			//example: /pam
			// Enables SMTP server authentication of remote SMTP clients. Account
			// names and passwords are taken from the specified secrets file. The
			// secrets file should contain lines that have four space-separated
			// fields, starting with "server" in the first field; the second field
			// is the password encoding ("plain" or "md5"), the third is the client
			// user-id and the fourth is the password. The user-id is RFC-1891 xtext
			// encoded, and the password is either xtext encoded or generated by
			// "emailrelay-passwd". A special value of "/pam" can be used for
			// authentication using linux PAM.

		"e!close-stderr!closes the standard error stream soon after start-up!!0!!3|"
			// Causes the standard error stream to be closed soon after start-up.
			// This is useful when operating as a backgroud daemon and it is
			// therefore implied by --as-server and --as-proxy.

		"a!admin!enables the administration interface and specifies its listening port number!!1!admin-port!3|"
			//example: 587
			// Enables an administration interface on the specified listening port
			// number. Use telnet or something similar to connect. The administration
			// interface can be used to trigger forwarding of spooled mail messages
			// if the --forward-to option is used.

		"x!dont-serve!disables acting as a server on any port! (part of --as-client and usually used with --forward)!0!!3|"
			// Disables all network serving, including SMTP, POP and administration
			// interfaces. The program will terminate as soon as any initial

			// Disables listening for incoming SMTP connections.

		"z!filter!specifies an external program to process messages as they are stored!!1!program!3|"
			//example: /usr/local/sbin/emailrelay-filter
			//example: C:/Program\ Files/E-MailRelay/filter.bat
			//example: net:127.0.0.1:1111
			//example: spam:[::1].783
			//example: exit:103
			// Runs the specified external filter program whenever a mail message is
			// stored. The filter is passed the name of the message file in the
			// spool directory so that it can edit it as required. The mail message
			// is rejected if the filter program terminates with an exit code between
			// 1 and 99. Use "net:<transport-address>" to communicate with a filter
			// daemon over the network, or "spam:<transport-address>" to talk to a
			// spamassassin spamd daemon, or "exit:<number>" to emulate a filter
			// program that just exits.

		"W!filter-timeout!sets the timeout (in seconds) for running the --filter (default is 300)!!1!time!3|"
			//example: 10
			// Specifies a timeout (in seconds) for running a --filter program. The
			// default is 300 seconds.

		"w!prompt-timeout!sets the timeout (in seconds) for getting an initial prompt from the server (default is 20)!!1!time!3|"
			//example: 3
			// Specifies a timeout (in seconds) for getting the initial prompt from

			//example: smtp.example.com
			// Specifies the network name that is used in SMTP EHLO commands,
			// "Received" lines, and for generating authentication challenges.
			// The default network name it derived from a DNS lookup of the local

		"f!forward!forwards stored mail on startup! (requires --forward-to)!0!!3|"
			// Causes spooled mail messages to be forwarded when the program first
			// starts.

			// use for mail message forwarding.

		"T!response-timeout!sets the response timeout (in seconds) when talking to a remote server (default is 1800)!!1!time!3|"
			//default: 1800
			//example: 2
			// Specifies a timeout (in seconds) for getting responses from remote
			// SMTP servers. The default is 1800 seconds.

		"U!connection-timeout!sets the timeout (in seconds) when connecting to a remote server (default is 40)!!1!time!3|"
			//default: 40
			//example: 10
			// Specifies a timeout (in seconds) for establishing a TCP connection
			// to remote SMTP servers. The default is 40 seconds.

		"m!immediate!enables immediate forwarding of messages as soon as they are received! from the submitting client and before their receipt is acknowledged (requires --forward-to)!0!!3|"
			// Causes mail messages to be forwarded as soon as they are submitted,
			// even before they are accepted. This can be used to do proxying
			// without store-and-forward, but in practice clients tend to to time out
			// while waiting for their mail message to be accepted.

		"I!interface!defines the listening network addresses used for incoming connections! (comma-separated list with optional smtp=,pop=,admin= qualifiers)!2!ip-address-list!3|"
			//example: 192.168.0.1,127.0.0.1,::1
			// Specifies the IP network addresses used to bind listening ports. By
			// default listening ports for incoming SMTP, POP and administration
			// connections will bind the 'any' address for IPv4 and for IPv6,
			// ie. "0.0.0.0" and "::". Use this option to limit listening to particular
			// addresses (and by implication to particular network interfaces).
			// Multiple addresses can be specified by using the option more than
			// once or by using a comma-separated list. Use a prefix of "smtp=", "pop="
			// or "admin=" on addresses that should apply only to those types of
			// listening port.

		"6!client-interface!defines the local network address used for outgoing connections!!1!ip-address!3|"
			//example: 10.0.0.2
			// Specifies the IP network address to be used to bind the local end of
			// outgoing SMTP connections. By default the address will depend on the
			// routing tables in the normal way. Use "0.0.0.0" to use only IPv4
			// addresses returned from DNS lookups of the --forward-to address,
			// or "::" for IPv6.

		"i!pid-file!defines a file for storing the daemon process-id!!1!pid-file!3|"
			//example: /var/run/emailrelay/emailrelay.pid
			//example: C:/ProgramData/E-MailRelay/pid.txt
			// Causes the process-id to be written into the specified file when the
			// program starts up, typically after it has become a backgroud daemon.

		"O!poll!enables polling of the spool directory for messages to be forwarded with the specified period! (requires --forward-to)!1!period!3|"
			//example: 60
			// Causes forwarding of spooled mail messages to happen at regular intervals
			// (with the time given in seconds).

		"!address-verifier!specifies an external program for address verification!!1!program!3|"
			//example: /usr/local/sbin/emailrelay-verifier.sh
			//example: C:/ProgramData/E-MailRelay/verifier.js
			// Runs the specified external program to verify a message recipent's e-mail
			// address. A network verifier can be specified as "net:<transport-address>".

		"Y!client-filter!specifies an external program to process messages when they are forwarded!!1!program!3|"
			//example: /usr/local/sbin/emailrelay-client-filter
			//example: C:/ProgramData/E-MailRelay/client-filter.js
			// Runs the specified external filter program whenever a mail message is
			// forwarded. The filter is passed the name of the message file in the spool
			// directory so that it can edit it as required. A network filter can be
			// specified as "net:<transport-address>" and prefixes of "spam:" and "exit:"
			// are also allowed. The --filter option is normally more useful
			// than --client-filter.

		"Q!admin-terminate!enables the terminate command on the admin interface!!0!!3|"
			// Enables the "terminate" command in the administration interface.

		"A!anonymous!disables the SMTP VRFY command and sends less verbose SMTP responses!!0!!3|"
			// Disables the server's SMTP VRFY command, sends less verbose SMTP
			// responses and SMTP greeting, and stops "Received" lines being
			// added to mail message content files.

		"B!pop!enables the pop server!!0!!3|"
			// Enables the POP server listening, by default on port 110, providing
			// access to spooled mail messages. Negotiated TLS using the POP3 "STLS"
			// command will be enabled if the --server-tls option is also given.

		"E!pop-port!specifies the pop listening port number (default is 110)! (requires --pop)!1!port!3|"
			//default: 110
			//example: 995
			// Sets the POP server's listening port number.

		"F!pop-auth!defines the pop server secrets file!!1!file!3|"
			//example: /etc/private/emailrelay-pop.auth
			//example: C:/ProgramData/E-MailRelay/pop.auth
			//example: /pam
			// Specifies a file containing valid POP account details. The file
			// format is the same as for the SMTP server secrets file, ie. lines
			// starting with "server", with user-id and password in the third
			// and fourth fields. A special value of "/pam" can be used for
			// authentication using linux PAM.

		"G!pop-no-delete!disables message deletion via pop! (requires --pop)!0!!3|"
			// Disables the POP DELE command so that the command appears to succeed
			// but mail messages are not deleted from the spool directory.

		"J!pop-by-name!modifies the pop spool directory according to the pop user name! (requires --pop)!0!!3|"
			// Modifies the spool directory used by the POP server to be a
			// sub-directory with the same name as the POP authentication user-id.
			// This allows multiple POP clients to read the spooled messages
			// without interfering with each other. Content files can stay in
			// the main spool directory with the envelope files copied into
			// user-specific sub-directories. The "emailrelay-filter-copy"
			// program is a convenient way of doing this when run via
			// --filter.

		"M!size!limits the size of submitted messages!!1!bytes!3|"
			//example: 10000000
			// Limits the size of mail messages that can be submitted over SMTP.
