E-MailRelay Change Log
======================

1.8.2 -> 1.9
------------
* Added negotiated TLS/SSL for POP (ie. "STLS").
* The first two fields in the secrets files are reordered (with backwards compatibility).
* Added Linux-PAM authentication ("configure --with-pam" and then "--server-auth=/pam").
* Optional protocol-specific "--interface" qualifiers, eg. "--interface smtp=127.0.0.1,pop=192.168.1.1".
* Outgoing client connection bound with the first "--interface" or "--interface client=..." address.
* Support for SMTP-over-TLS on outgoing client connection ("--client-tls-connection") (cf. "STARTTLS")
* Support for SOCKS 4a on outgoing client connection, eg. "--forward-to example.com:25@127.0.0.1:9050".
* TLS configuration options ("--tls-config=...") for SSLv2/3 fallback etc.
* No "Received" line added if "--anonymous" and an empty "--domain" name.
* Error text for "all recipients rejected" is now more accurately "one or more recipients rejected".
* New behaviour for "--client-filter" exit values of 100 and over.
* New commands on the admin interface, "failures" and "unfail-all".
