E-MailRelay Change Log
======================

1.7 -> 1.8
----------
* Speed optimisations (using KCachegrind/valgrind in KDevelop).
* Size optimisations at configure-time (eg. "./configure --disable-exec").
* A warning is printed if logging is requested but both stderr and syslog are disabled.
* SMTP client protocol emits a RSET after a rejected recipient as a workround for broken server protocols.
* SMTP client protocol tries to continue if the server advertises AUTH but the client has no authentication secrets.
* When a message cannot be forwarded the offending SMTP protocol response number, if any, is put in the envelope file.
* Toolchain builder for embedded mips-based routers added as an extra.
* New example script for SMTP multicasting.
* Compatibility with gcc 2.95 restored.

1.6 -> 1.7
----------
* TLS/SSL support for SMTP using OpenSSL ("./configure --with-openssl" with "--client-tls" and "--server-tls").
* Authentication mechanism "PLAIN" added.
* Some tightening up of the SMTP server protocol.
* Windows service wrapper has an "--uninstall" option.
* Windows installation GUI uninstalls the service before reinstalling it.

1.5 -> 1.6
----------

* New "--prompt-timeout" switch for the timeout when waiting for the initial 220 prompt from the SMTP server.
* Fix for flow-control assertion error when the POP server sends a very long list of spooled messages.
* Wildcard matching for trusted IP addresses in the authentication secrets file can now use CIDR notation.
* More fine-grained switching of effective user-id to read files and directories when running as root.
* Fewer new client connections when proxying.
* The server drops the connection if a remote SMTP client causes too many protocol errors.
* More complete implementation of "--hidden" on Windows.
* Scanner switch ("--scanner") replaced by a more general "--filter" and "--client-filter" switch syntax.

* Windows "cscript.exe" wrapper is added automatically to non-bat/exe "--filter" command-lines.
* Installation GUI makes backups of the files it edits and preserves authentication secrets.
* Installation GUI can install "init.d" links.

* Acceptance tests added to the distribution.
