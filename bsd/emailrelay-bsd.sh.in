# Start/stop wrapper for E-MailRelay on FreeBSD, installed as
# "/etc/rc.d/emailrelay" or "/usr/local/etc/rc.d/emailrelay".
#
# Requires the following line to be added to "/etc/rc.conf":
#
#    emailrelay_enable="YES"
#
# Delegates to the linux start/stop script, which reads default directories
# from "/etc/rc.conf.d/emailrelay" (if present) and server command-line
# options from "/usr/local/etc/emailrelay.conf".
#
# See also man rc(8), man service(8)
