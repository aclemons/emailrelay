# xar
#
# A replacement for 'ar' that uses the Workshop compiler 
# as 'CC -xar'. It also discards autoconf's bogus "cru" 
# command-line argument.
#
# For example:
# $ chmod +x lib/sunpro5/xar
# $ ./configure --enable-whatever AR=`pwd`/lib/sunpro5/xar
#
# Or just:
# $ ./configure --enable-workshop
#
# Also note that gcc on solaris may require:
# $ ./configure --enable-whatever AR=/usr/ccs/bin/ar
#
CC="CC" 
if test -x "${CXX}" ; then CC="${CXX}" ; fi
if test "${1}" = "--cxx" ; then CC="${2}" ; shift ; shift ; fi
shift # get rid of "cru" flags
exec ${CC} -xar -o "$@"
