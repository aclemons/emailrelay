# txt2html.sh
#
# Converts specially-formatted plain-text to html. 
# Uses "expand.sh", "txt2mu.sh" and "mu2html.sh".
# See also "index.sh".
#
# The "-t" (text-mode) switch can be used for
# non-technical input text.
#
# The "-x" (exclude) switch excludes html header
# and footer from the output.
#
# usage: txt2html.sh [-a <awk-binary>] [-v] [-x] [-t] [<input-file> [<stylesheet> [<graphics-dir> [<title>]]]]
