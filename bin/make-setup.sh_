# make-setup.sh
#
# Builds a "setup" self-extracting archive -- or a payload file for
# one -- derived from running "make install" into a temporary directory.
#
# usage: make-setup.sh [-d] <output> <stub> <pack-utility> <icon>
#
# Normally run by "make setup" in the "src/gui".
#
# The packed files are those that appear under "/usr", which 
# matches the default installation directory presented in the 
# gui (see Dir::os_install()).
#
# There is only one level of packing, so the gui executable 
# should be statically linked or repacked with its shared 
# libraries if targeting other machines.
